        "AB": "A 40-year-old woman admitted for hyponatremia and anasarca due to decompensated cirrhosis after a recent steroid taper developed extremely painful cutaneous breast lesions clinically mimicking cellulitis and inflammatory breast cancer and was biopsy-diagnosed instead with diffuse dermal angiomatosis (DDA) of the breasts, a rare and painful disease that can be a diagnostic chameleon. This case highlights the importance of early surgical consultation and tissue biopsy to correctly diagnose the etiology of severely painful mastitis and prevent prolonged symptomology and repeated administrations of ineffective treatments. Diffuse dermal angiomatosis should be considered when suspected breast cellulitis is refractory to treatment or there is concern for inflammatory breast cancer, especially in pendulous-breasted women with comorbidities that increase susceptibility to local tissue hypoxia.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing in oncology promises a high impact on many patients through its ability to provide access to novel, fast-tracked treatments. Previous studies have demonstrated that depression may influence tumor progression. Anti-proliferative activity of certain antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to repurpose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating breast cancers, and it merits the pursuit of drug repositioning in oncology. EXPERIMENTAL: Changes in cell morphology were studied using DAPI staining, and the Annexin V/PI method was employed for apoptotic analysis. The expression of specific genes involved in cancer progression was also analyzed via RT-PCR. Caspase-3 activation was observed through fluorometric assay. RESULTS: We have identified that sertraline hydrochloride most effectively inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell cells in vitro. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of sertraline hydrochloride was possibly through the induction of apoptosis, as inferred from enhanced nuclear fragmentation, flow cytometric data, and caspase-3/7 activation. Gene expression analysis also showed an increased expression of proapoptotic Bax and a slight decrease in oncogene c-myc in the presence of sertraline hydrochloride. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that sertraline hydrochloride, an antidepressant, can potentially be used for the treatment of breast cancer.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a promising, minimally invasive treatment for cancer with high immunostimulatory potential, no reported drug resistance, and reduced side effects. Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been used as a photosensitizer (PS) for PDT, although its poor stability and low tumor-target specificity strongly limit its efficacy. To overcome these limitations, ICG can be formulated as a tumor-targeting nanoparticle (NP). METHODS: We nanoformulated ICG into recombinant heavy-ferritin nanocages (HFn-ICG). HFn has a specific interaction with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is overexpressed in most tumors, thus increasing HFn tumor tropism. First, we tested the properties of HFn-ICG as a PS upon irradiation with a continuous-wave diode laser. Then, we evaluated PDT efficacy in two breast cancer (BC) cell lines with different TfR1 expression levels. Finally, we measured the levels of intracellular endogenous heavy ferritin (H-Fn) after PDT treatment. In fact, it is known that cells undergoing ROS-induced autophagy, as in PDT, tend to increase their ferritin levels as a defence mechanism. By measuring intracellular H-Fn, we verified whether this interplay between internalized HFn and endogenous H-Fn could be used to maximize HFn uptake and PDT efficacy. RESULTS: We previously demonstrated that HFn-ICG stabilized ICG molecules and increased their delivery to the target site in vitro and in vivo for fluorescence guided surgery. Here, with the aim of using HFn-ICG for PDT, we showed that HFn-ICG improved treatment efficacy in BC cells, depending on their TfR1 expression. Our data revealed that endogenous H-Fn levels were increased after PDT treatment, suggesting that this defence reaction against oxidative stress could be used to enhance HFn-ICG uptake in cells, increasing treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The strong PDT efficacy and peculiar Trojan horse-like mechanism, that we revealed for the first time in literature, confirmed the promising application of HFn-ICG in PDT.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Ferroptosis, a promising mechanism of killing cancer cells, has become a research hotspot in cancer therapy. Simvastatin (SIM), as a potential new anti-breast cancer drug, has been shown to cause ferroptosis of cancer cells and inhibit breast cancer metastasis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel strategy boosting ferroptotic cascade for synergistic cancer therapy. METHODS: In this paper, iron base form of layered double hydroxide supported simvastatin (LDHs-SIM) was synthesized by hydrothermal co-precipitation method. The characterization of LDHs-SIM were assessed by various analytical techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Biological activity, ferroptosis mechanism and biocompatibility were analyzed through in vivo and in vitro analysis, so as to evaluate its therapeutic effect on breast cancer. RESULTS: The constructed LDHs-SIM nanosystem can not only release SIM through mevalonate (MVA) pathway, inhibit the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 and reduce the synthesis efficiency of GSH, but also promote the accumulation of Fe(2+) in cells through the release of Fe(3+), and increase the intracellular ROS content. In addition, LDHs-SIM nanosystem can induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells to a certain extent, and achieve the synergistic effect of apoptosis and ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we demonstrated that nanoparticles of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) loaded with simvastatin were more effective than a free drug at inhibiting breast cancer cell growth, In addition, superior anticancer therapeutic effects were achieved with little systemic toxicity, indicating that LDHs-SIM could serve as a safe and high-performance platform for ferroptosis-apoptosis combined anticancer therapy.",

        "AB": "ATP-binding cassette transporters represent a superfamily of dynamic membrane-based proteins with diverse yet common functions such as use of ATP hydrolysis to efflux substrates across cellular membranes. Three major transporters-P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1 or ABCC1), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2) are notoriously involved in therapy resistance in cancer patients. Despite exhaustive individual characterizations of each of these transporters, there is a lack of understanding in terms of the functional role of mutations in substrate binding and efflux, leading to drug resistance. We analyzed clinical variations reported in endometrial cancers for these transporters. For ABCB1, the majority of key mutations were present in the membrane-facing region, followed by the drug transport channel and ATP-binding regions. Similarly, for ABCG2, the majority of key mutations were located in the membrane-facing region, followed by the ATP-binding region and drug transport channel, thus highlighting the importance of membrane-mediated drug recruitment and efflux in ABCB1 and ABCG2. On the other hand, for ABCC1, the majority of key mutations were present in the inactive nucleotide-binding domain, followed by the drug transport channel and membrane-facing regions, highlighting the importance of the inactive nucleotide-binding domain in facilitating indirect drug efflux in ABCC1. The identified key mutations in endometrial cancer and mapped common mutations present across different types of cancers in ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 will facilitate the design and discovery of inhibitors targeting unexplored structural regions of these transporters and re-engineering of these transporters to tackle chemoresistance.",

        "AB": "Clinical and molecular similarities between canine mammary tumors (CMTs) and human breast cancer (HBC) propel scientists to further study their application in comparative oncology as a model for human breast cancer. In total, 64 canine mammary tumors were selected to study the most common markers, which are applicable for human breast cancer treatment, including estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human epidermal growth factor (HER2/neu), Ki67, and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the protein expression. The Veterinary Nottingham Prognostic Index (Vet-NPI) was also computed. Moreover, univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). The results demonstrated that Ki67 was strongly expressed in the triple-negative tumors, and Ki67 protein expression continuously increased over the increase of Cox2 protein expression (p < 0.001). Further analysis revealed a significant difference among canine mammary subtypes and Vet-NPI, in which triple-negative tumors displayed the highest mean score compared to other subtypes (p < 0.001). In addition, the multivariable analysis revealed that the regional mastectomy procedure (adjusted HR = 2.78 (1.14-6.8)), the triple-negative tumors (adjusted HR = 48.08 (7.74-298.8)), strong Ki67 protein expression group (adjusted HR = 7.88 (2.02-30.68)), and strong Cox2 protein expression group (adjusted HR = 29.35 (5.18-166.4)) demonstrated significantly lower disease-free survival rates compared to other corresponding groups. Overall, canine mammary tumors showed strong similarities to human breast cancer in terms of clinical and molecular aspects; therefore, they could be suggested as a model for human breast cancer in comparative oncology.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between receptor heterogeneity and clinicopathological characteristics in 166 patients with invasive breast cancer during metastasis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 166 patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer through biopsy, who were admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. Statistical analysis was employed to assess the heterogeneity of receptors in both primary and metastatic lesions, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), Ki67, as well as their association with clinicopathological features such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, treatment regimen, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: The discordant expression rates of ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 and Luminal classification between primary and metastatic lesions were 21.7%, 41.6%, 8.9%, 34.4% and 36.8%, respectively. There is a significant difference in disease-free survival between patients with consistent and inconsistent receptor status of primary and metastatic lesions, which is statistically significant. The median DFS for primary HER2(-) to metastatic HER2(+) was 84 months, which was relatively high. The Cox multivariate regression analysis revealed that the expression differences of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 were not influenced by endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. However, a statistically significant difference in HER2 expression was observed with targeted therapy. Tumor size was correlated with ER and Ki67 receptor status (P = 0.019, 0.016). Tumor size was not correlated with PR, and HER2 (P = 0.679, 0.440). Lymph node metastasis was not associated with changes in ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67. The discordant rates of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 in patients with local recurrence were 22%, 23.7%, 5.1%, and 28.8% respectively, whereas those in patients with distant metastasis were 21.5%, 36.4%, 10.3%, and 31.8% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 in primary and metastatic breast cancer exhibit heterogeneity, which is closely associated with the prognosis and treatment outcomes of patients.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor gene is one of the well-studied causes of cancer development. The drugs that reverse the process by driving demethylation could be a candidate for anticancer therapy. This study was designed to investigate the effects of arsenic disulfide on PTPL1 methylation in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: We knocked down the expression of PTPL1 in two DLBCL cell lines (i.e., DB and SU-DHL-4 cells) using siRNA. Then the DLBCL proliferation was determined in the presence of PTPL1 knockdown. The methylation of PTPL1 in DLBCL cells was analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSPCR). The effect of arsenic disulfide on the PTPL1 methylation was determined in DLBCL cell lines in the presence of different concentrations of arsenic disulfide (5 microM, 10 microM and 20 microM), respectively. To investigate the potential mechanism on the arsenic disulfide-mediated methylation, the mRNA expression of DNMT1, DNMT3B and MBD2 was determined. RESULTS: PTPL1 functioned as a tumor suppressor gene in DLBCL cells, which was featured by the fact that PTPL1 knockdown promoted the proliferation of DLBCL cells. PTPL1 was found hypermethylated in DLBCL cells. Arsenic disulfide promoted the PTPL1 demethylation in a dose-dependent manner, which was related to the inhibition of DNMTs and the increase of MBD2. CONCLUSION: Experimental evidence shows that PTPL1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in DLBCL progression. PTPL1 hyper-methylation could be reversed by arsenic disulfide in a dose-dependent manner.",

We explored the relationship between preoperative lymphocytes, neutrophils and albumin (LANR) and progression-free survival in breast cancer patients. METHODS: The clinical and follow-up data of 200 breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed in this study, and the value of LANR was determined as follows: LANR, lymphocytes x albumin/neutrophils. ROC curves, COX proportional risk regression analysis and subgroup analysis were used to assess the prognostic value of LANR in progression-free survival of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 55.5 years (range 50-62 years). The median follow-up time was 46 months (range 33-55 months). In progression-free survival, the area under the LANR curve was 0.748 and the HR (95% CI) was 0.035 (0.679-0.817). LANR was associated with age (p = 0.02), positive axillary lymph nodes (p < 0.001), TNM stage (p < 0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(p = 0.004). The results indicated that preoperative LANR may be a reliable predictor of progression-free survival in patients with operable breast cancer. CONCLUSION: LANR may be an essential predictor for breast cancer patients and provides a therapeutic basis for clinicians and patients.",

        "AB": "The majority of human breast cancers are dependent on hormone-stimulated estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and are sensitive to its inhibition. Treatment resistance arises in most advanced cancers due to genetic alterations that promote ligand independent activation of ER itself or ER target genes. Whereas re-targeting of the ER ligand binding domain (LBD) with newer ER antagonists can work in some cases, these drugs are largely ineffective in many genetic backgrounds including ER fusions that lose the LBD or in cancers that hyperactivate ER targets. By identifying the mechanism of ER translation, we herein present an alternative strategy to target ER and difficult to treat ER variants. We find that ER translation is cap-independent and mTOR inhibitor insensitive, but dependent on 5' UTR elements and sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF4A, an mRNA helicase. EIF4A inhibition rapidly reduces expression of ER and short-lived targets of ER such as cyclin D1 and other components of the cyclin D-CDK complex in breast cancer cells. These effects translate into suppression of growth of a variety of ligand-independent breast cancer models including those driven by ER fusion proteins that lack the ligand binding site. The efficacy of eIF4A inhibition is enhanced when it is combined with fulvestrant-an ER degrader. Concomitant inhibition of ER synthesis and induction of its degradation causes synergistic and durable inhibition of ER expression and tumor growth. The clinical importance of these findings is confirmed by results of an early clinical trial ( NCT04092673 ) of the selective eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin in patients with estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. Multiple clinical responses have been observed on combination therapy including durable regressions. These data suggest that eIF4A inhibition could be a useful new strategy for treating advanced ER+ breast cancer.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer subtype often treated with radiotherapy (RT). Due to its intrinsic heterogeneity and lack of effective targets, it is crucial to identify novel molecular targets that would increase RT efficacy. Here we demonstrate the role of BUB1 (cell cycle Ser/Thr kinase) in TNBC radioresistance and offer a novel strategy to improve TNBC treatment. METHODS: Gene expression analysis was performed to look at genes upregulated in TNBC patient samples compared to other subtypes. Cell proliferation and clonogenic survivals assays determined the IC (50) of BUB1 inhibitor (BAY1816032) and radiation enhancement ratio (rER) with pharmacologic and genomic BUB1 inhibition. Mammary fat pad xenografts experiments were performed in CB17/SCID. The mechanism through which BUB1 inhibitor sensitizes TNBC cells to radiotherapy was delineated by gamma-H2AX foci assays, BLRR, Immunoblotting, qPCR, CHX chase, and cell fractionation assays. RESULTS: BUB1 is overexpressed in BC and its expression is considerably elevated in TNBC with poor survival outcomes. Pharmacological or genomic ablation of BUB1 sensitized multiple TNBC cell lines to cell killing by radiation, although breast epithelial cells showed no radiosensitization with BUB1 inhibition. Kinase function of BUB1 is mainly accountable for this radiosensitization phenotype. BUB1 ablation also led to radiosensitization in TNBC tumor xenografts with significantly increased tumor growth delay and overall survival. Mechanistically, BUB1 ablation inhibited the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). BUB1 ablation stabilized phospho-DNAPKcs (S2056) following RT such that half-lives could not be estimated. In contrast, RT alone caused BUB1 stabilization, but pre-treatment with BUB1 inhibitor prevented stabilization (t (1/2) ,  approximately 8 h). Nuclear and chromatin-enriched fractionations illustrated an increase in recruitment of phospho- and total-DNAPK, and KAP1 to chromatin indicating that BUB1 is indispensable in the activation and recruitment of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) proteins to DSBs. Additionally, BUB1 staining of TNBC tissue microarrays demonstrated significant correlation of BUB1 protein expression with tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS: BUB1 ablation sensitizes TNBC cell lines and xenografts to RT and BUB1 mediated radiosensitization may occur through NHEJ. Together, these results highlight BUB1 as a novel molecular target for radiosensitization in women with TNBC.",

        "AB": "Purpose Breast cancer surgery, even with reconstruction, can make it difficult for patients to find a bra that fits properly, is comfortable, and meets their aesthetic standards. We explored breast cancer survivors' experiences with bras over time to identify preferences, needs, and challenges throughout their journeys. Methods Fifteen women who had undergone mastectomy and either delayed or immediate breast reconstruction participated in the study. Focus groups were conducted to explore the participants' current experiences with bras. They were also prompted to recall their experiences before mastectomy and immediately after reconstruction. The discussion included bra materials, styles, construction techniques, color, quality, and price. Results Thematic analysis generated five major themes: \"Sense of normalcy and personal well-being,\" \"Struggles immediately following surgery,\" \"Transitions in bra experiences and preference,\" \"Practicality with outfit,\" and \"Association between quality and price\". Conclusion Breast cancer survivors' well-being is linked to their experiences with bras and the associated purchasing process, and bra needs change throughout the cancer care journey. Survivors' experiences with bras impact their sense of normalcy and sense of control over significant bodily changes arising from cancer and its treatment. The study underscores the importance of future research on examining the relationship between survivors' quality of life and garment experiences, including factors such as color choices, closure options, and adjustability for individual needs.",

        "AB": "Mechanical force exerted on cancer cells by their microenvironment have been reported to drive cells toward invasive phenotypes by altering cells' motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. These mechanical forces include compressive, tensile, hydrostatic, and shear forces. The importance of forces is then hypothesized to be an alteration of cancer cells' and their microenvironment's biophysical properties as the indicator of a tumor's malignancy state. Our objective is to investigate and quantify the correlation between a tumor's malignancy state and forces experienced by the cancer cells and components of the microenvironment. In this study, we have developed a multicomponent, three-dimensional model of tumor tissue consisting of a cancer cell surrounded by fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). Our results on three different organs including breast, kidney, and pancreas show that: A) the stresses within tumor tissue are impacted by the organ specific ECM's biophysical properties, B) more invasive cancer cells experience higher stresses, C) in pancreas which has a softer ECM (Young modulus of 1.0 kPa) and stiffer cancer cells (Young modulus of 2.4 kPa and 1.7 kPa) than breast and kidney, cancer cells experienced significantly higher stresses, D) cancer cells in contact with ECM experienced higher stresses compared to cells surrounded by fibroblasts but the area of tumor stroma experiencing high stresses has a maximum length of 40 mum when the cancer cell is surrounded by fibroblasts and 12 mum for when the cancer cell is in vicinity of ECM. This study serves as an important first step in understanding of how the stresses experienced by cancer cells, fibroblasts, and ECM are associated with malignancy states of cancer cells in different organs. The quantification of forces exerted on cancer cells by different organ-specific ECM and at different stages of malignancy will help, first to develop theranostic strategies, second to predict accurately which tumors will become highly malignant, and third to establish accurate criteria controlling the progression of cancer cells malignancy. Furthermore, our in silico model of tumor tissue can yield critical, useful information for guiding ex vivo or in vitro experiments, narrowing down variables to be investigated, understanding what factors could be impacting cancer treatments or even biomarkers to be looking for.",

        "AB": "Invasive papillary carcinoma (IPC) of the breast is a rare form of cancer. The current report documents a case of IPC characterized by a large tumor size and skin involvement. Surgical exploration revealed no evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. Due to financial constraints, the patient opted solely for anastrozole endocrine therapy at a dosage of 1 mg/day for a period of 5 years post-surgery, foregoing other treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Since discharge, 2.5 years have passed, during which the patient has been followed up via phone every 3 months, showing a good prognosis. A literature review indicated that IPC is prevalent amongst the elderly population and can be misdiagnosed due to its morphological, cytomorphological and immunophenotypic overlap with other types of papillary neoplasms. This tumor exhibits a more favorable prognosis compared with IDC, primarily attributed to its advantageous gene and molecular expression patterns, coupled with its decreased invasiveness. Despite limited evidence-based research on the treatment of IPC, the present case report, albeit with limitations, underscores the importance of avoiding over-treatment and suggests the feasibility of combining surgery with endocrine therapy for IPC.",

        "AB": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with a high, lifetime risk of a broad spectrum of cancers caused by pathogenic germline TP53 mutations. Numerous different germline TP53 mutations have been associated with LFS, which has an exceptionally diverse clinical spectrum in terms of tumor type and age of onset. Our patient has developed six asynchronous tumors to date: a phyllode tumor of the breast, a pheochromocytoma, a rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT), an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a ductal carcinoma of the breast, and a thymoma. The occurrence of such a number of rare tumors is sporadic even among in the population of patients living with cancer predisposition syndromes. In this instance, the omission of pretest genetic counseling and thorough family tree analysis prior to selecting the test led to the oversight of an underlying TP53 likely pathogenic mutation (classified as Class 4). This emphasizes the necessity for such counseling to prevent overlooking crucial genetic information. Neglecting this step could have had profound implications on the patient's treatment, particularly considering the early onset and occurrence of multiple tumors, which typically raise suspicion of a hereditary component. The implications for family members must be considered.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer is the most common cause of malignancy and the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women. This heterogeneous disease is currently broadly classified as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) positive luminal tumors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified tumors and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Phytochemicals are proven to be promising anti-cancer chemotherapeutics agents with minimal cytotoxic effects on normal cells. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) is a phytochemical derived from the roots of Plumbago zeylanica and it is known to possess anti-cancer properties similar to other compounds of naphthoquinones. In about 90% of cancer cells, the telomerase enzyme activity is revived to add telomeric repeats to evade apoptosis. In this study, a combinatorial approach of combining the anti-cancer compound plumbagin to induce genotoxicity and a potent telomerase inhibitor, MST-312 (synthetic derivative of tea catechins), was used to determine the combinational treatment-induced lethality in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) and MCF-7 (lumina) cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were responsive to combination treatment in both short-term (48 h) and long-term treatment (14 days) in a synergistic manner, whereas in MCF-7, the combination treatment was more effective in the long-term regimen. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of the plumbagin and MST-312 combination treatment were not recoverable after the short-term treatment. In conclusion, a combination treatment of MST-312 and plumbagin is proven to be more effective than a single plumbagin compound treatment in inducing DNA damage and telomere dysfunction leading to greater genome instability, cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death in cancer cells.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study explores the impact of a nursing intervention grounded in empowerment theory, focusing on behavioral change, on brain metastasis patients post-breast cancer surgery. METHODS: Between June 2021 and June 2023, 102 patients diagnosed with brain metastasis after breast cancer surgery at Bao Ding No.1 Central Hospital were randomized into two groups. The control group (51 patients) received standard nursing care, while the observation group (51 patients) participated in a behavioral change nursing intervention influenced by empowerment theory. The evaluation metrics included measures of negative emotions, compliance with treatment protocols, overall quality of life, and nursing satisfaction, assessed at multiple time points during the study period. RESULTS: The intervention led to significant reductions in negative emotions for all patients when compared to their pre-intervention statuses, with the observation group exhibiting notably lower depression and anxiety scores at one and three months post-intervention (P < 0.05). Additionally, this group achieved higher compliance scores and demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life than the control group (P < 0.05). Nursing satisfaction was also significantly higher in the observation group, with 96.08% reporting high satisfaction compared to 80.39% in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Implementing a nursing intervention that emphasizes behavioral changes and leverages empowerment theory significantly enhances the quality of life, reduces negative emotions, boosts compliance with treatment, and increases nursing satisfaction among patients with brain metastasis following breast cancer surgery. This suggests that such interventions could be a valuable component of postoperative care for this patient population.",

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study that included 53 women diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction from January 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-nine patients (54.7%) had SF elevation, and 24 patients (45.3%) underwent SM elevation. We evaluated patient-reported early postoperative pain on the first day after surgery. Also, it was reported that all surgical complications in the first month and patient reported outcomes (PROs) were measured with the BRECON 23 questionnaire. RESULTS: The serratus fascia group used implants with larger volumes, 407.6 +/- 98.9 cc (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the fascial and muscular groups regarding the postoperative pain score reported by the patients (2 versus 3; p = 0.30). Also, there was no difference between the groups regarding early surgical complications and PROs after breast reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The use of SF seems to cause less morbidity, which makes the technique an alternative to be considered in breast reconstruction. Although there was no statistical difference in postoperative pain scores between the fascia and serratus muscle groups.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Fertility preservation is a priority in oncology for female cancer patients. However, there is a lack of communication between infertility specialists and oncologists. This study aimed to evaluate infertility specialists' perceptions and experiences regarding fertility preservation. METHODS: Conduct an online survey to profile infertility specialists. Participants were infertility affiliated with the Brazilian Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Associations (FEBRASGO). The specialists received an online survey, which response rate were 30.9%, most of whom were in southern and southeastern. The survey consisted on 14 questions about the infertility specialists' location, techniques in clinical practice, treatment successful rate, patients idea, etc. RESULTS: The average experience in human reproduction were 15.5 +/- 10.2 years (mean +/- standard deviation, range 1-40). Among reproductive-aged female cancer patients recommended for fertility preservation, 60.3 +/- 28.8% (range 10-100%) underwent preservation procedures. Main barriers were cost (41%), oncologists' knowledge or acceptance (35%) and accessibility (9%). Most infertility specialists (58%) considered 40 years the limit for fertility preservation. Leukemia, lymphoma, breast and ovarian cancers were prioritized for fertility preservation, while lung, thyroid, gastric, and brain cancers were less relevant. CONCLUSION: This is the first Brazilian study about infertility specialists' perceptions on oncology patients access to fertility preservation. These patients primarily receive treatment in the public health system, while infertility specialists mainly work in the private healthcare. This healthcare mode is currently fragmented, but integrating these experts is enhancing patient access to fertility preservation. Studies on this topic are still warranted.",

        "AB": "Palliative radiation is often used to abate pain and prevent bone fractures in patients with metastatic cancer. Hypofractionation, meaning delivery of larger doses of radiation in each treatment session (fraction), has become the standard of care in most cases. It not only reduces the burden on the medical system and facilitates the relief of symptoms but also enables the maintenance of the continuity of systemic therapy. Radiation recall phenomenon (RRP) is an acute inflammatory reaction in previously irradiated tissues that is provoked by chemotherapeutic drug administration. The incidence, severity, and prognosis of RRP following hypofractionated radiation therapy have not been studied. The symptoms of RRP depend on the radiation field, with the greatest concern associated with mucosal and dermal damage, though other symptoms have also been reported. Here, we describe a case of a 41-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative), who received palliative radiation to four other fields along the course of her disease, before her presentation with isolated myonecrosis of the thigh muscles. This RRP occurred four months following the last of two fractions of 8 Gy radiation to this region, given three months apart, and after six courses of cisplatin + gemcitabine. The symptoms improved with cessation of gemcitabine and prolonged administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed malignancy in women globally, and drug resistance is among the major obstacles to effective breast cancer treatment. Emerging evidence indicates that photothermal therapy and ferroptosis are both promising therapeutic techniques for the treatment of drug-resistant breast tumors. In this study, we proposed a thermal/ferroptosis/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) triple functional nanoparticle (I@P-ss-FRT) in which ferritin, an iron storage material with excellent cellular uptake capacity, was attached via disulfide bonds onto polydopamine coated iron oxide nanoparticle (I@P) as photothermal transduction agent and MRI probe. I@P-ss-FRT converted the near-infrared light (NIR) into localized heat which accelerated the release of ferrous ions from ferritin accomplished by glutathione reduction and subsequently induced ferroptosis. The drug-resistant cancer cell lines exhibited a more significant uptake of I@P-ss-FRT and sensitivity to PTT/ferroptosis compared with normal cancer cell lines. In vivo, I@P-ss-FRT plus NIR displayed the best tumor-killing potential with inhibitory rate of 83.46 %, along with a decline in GSH/GPX-4 content and an increase in lipid peroxides generation at tumor sites. Therefore, I@P-ss-FRT can be applied to combat drug-resistant breast cancer.",

        "AB": "In the last ten years, there has been a notable rise in the study of metabolic abnormalities in cancer cells. However, compared to glucose or glutamine metabolism, less attention has been paid to the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis. Recent developments in lipidomics technologies have allowed for detailed analysis of lipid profiles within cancer cells and other cellular players present within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its bioactive components have a long history of use in cancer treatments and are also being studied for their potential role in regulating metabolic reprogramming within TME. This review focuses on four core abnormalities altered by lipid reprogramming in cancer cells: de novo synthesis and exogenous uptake of fatty acids (FAs), upregulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), cholesterol accumulation, which offer benefits for tumor growth and metastasis. The review also discusses how altered lipid metabolism impacts infiltrating immune cell function and phenotype as these interactions between cancer-stromal become more pronounced during tumor progression. Finally, recent literature is highlighted regarding how cancer cells can be metabolically reprogrammed by specific Chinese herbal components with potential therapeutic benefits related to lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: As the second most common gynecological cancer, cervical cancer (CC) seriously threatens women's health. The poor prognosis of CC is closely related to the post-infection microenvironment (PIM). This study investigated how lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) affect CC PIM and their role in diagnosing CC. METHODS: We analyzed lipid metabolism scores in the CC single-cell landscape by AUCell. The differentiation trajectory of epithelial cells to cancer cells was revealed using LMRGs and Monocle2. Consensus clustering was used to identify novel subgroups using the LMRGs. Multiple immune assessment methods were used to evaluate the immune landscape of the subgroups. Prognostic genes were determined by the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Finally, we perform molecular docking of prognostic genes to explore potential therapeutic agents. RESULTS: We revealed the differentiation trajectory of epithelial cells to cancer cells in CC by LMRGs. The higher LMRGs expression cluster had higher survival rates and immune infiltration expression. Functional enrichment showed that two clusters were mainly involved in immune response regulation. A novel LMR signature (LMR.sig) was constructed to predict clinical outcomes in CC. The expression of prognostic genes was correlated with the PIM immune landscape. Small molecular compounds with the best binding effect to prognostic genes were obtained by molecular docking, which may be used as new targeted therapeutic drugs. CONCLUSION: We found that the subtype with better prognosis could regulate the expression of some critical genes through more frequent lipid metabolic reprogramming, thus affecting the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expression of M1 macrophages, reshaping the immunosuppressive environment of PIM in CC patients. LMRGs are closely related to the PIM immune landscape and can accurately predict tumor prognosis. These results further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of LMRGs in CC.",

        "AB": "Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) is a perennial plant used to treat menopause. This plant is known to have a serotonergic rather than estrogenic impact. It has been recommended to treat vasomotor symptoms associated with breast cancer patients. It also relieves symptoms such as night sweats and hot flashes, commonly called vasorelaxation. The variability in the study's results, doses, and assessment methods requires more rigorous research to establish its efficacy and safety. Standardized trials are needed to provide more precise information on the benefits and limitations of menopause treatment, informing women seeking alternatives to hormone therapy. Black cohosh has shown the potential to reduce the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment. In addition to its effectiveness in alleviating night sweats and hot flashes, the vasorelaxation properties contribute to its overall positive impact on menopausal symptoms. Due to discrepancies, varying dosages, and assessment techniques, further comprehensive studies are essential to determine the optimal dosage, long-term safety, and overall efficacy. Only through standardized trials can women make informed decisions about black cohosh as a viable alternative to hormone therapy during menopause.",

        "AB": "As a critical mitotic regulator, Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is aberrantly activated in a wide range of cancers. Therapeutic targeting of AUKRA is a promising strategy for the treatment of solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated the preclinical characteristics of JAB-2485, a small-molecule inhibitor of AURKA currently in Phase I/IIa clinical trial in the US (NCT05490472). Biochemical studies demonstrated that JAB-2485 is potent and highly selective on AURKA, with subnanomolar IC(50) and around 1500-fold selectivity over AURKB or AURKC. In addition, JAB-2485 exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties featured by low clearance and good bioavailability, strong dose-response relationship, as well as low risk for hematotoxicity and off-target liability. As a single agent, JAB-2485 effectively induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, JAB-2485 exhibited robust in vivo antitumor activity both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapies or the bromodomain inhibitor JAB-8263 in xenograft models of various cancer types. Together, these encouraging preclinical data provide a strong basis for safety and efficacy evaluations of JAB-2485 in the clinical setting.",

        "AB": "Despite multiple recent advances in systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer, cases which display suboptimal response to guideline-driven treatment are frequently seen in the clinic. Effective options for such patients are limited, particularly in later line of therapy, and selection of optimal treatment options is essentially empirical and based largely on considerations of previous regimens received. Comprehensive cancer profiling includes detection of genetic alterations in tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), immunohistochemistry (IHC) from re-biopsied metastatic disease, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), gene expression analysis and pharmacogenomics. The advent of this methodology and application to metastatic breast cancer, facilitates a more scientifically informed approach to identification of optimal systemic therapy approaches independent of the restrictions implied by clinical guidelines. Here we describe a case of metastatic breast cancer where consecutive comprehensive tumor profiling reveals ongoing tumor evolution, guiding the identification of novel effective therapeutic strategies.",

        "AB": "First line endocrine therapy is the gold standard for advanced estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. Adding CDK4/6 inhibitors has improved progression free survival. Metronomic Capecitabine has proven to be safe to combine with endocrine therapy with promising efficacy. We conducted a phase II randomized, open label, single centre clinical trial on patients with metastatic ER positive and HER 2 negative breast cancer. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to arm A: metronomic dose of capecitabine (500 mg/m(2) BID) combined with letrozole (2.5 mg OD) or arm B: letrozole single agent. The primary endpoint was progression free survival. The study was terminated early due to poor accrual and 60 eligible patients out of the planned 204 were randomized. This clinical trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (MD-127-2019, NCT04571437). Between February 2019 and April 2022, 60 patients were randomized. This is the first report of the study, after a median follow-up of 18.6 months. The median age at diagnosis was 47 years with only 41.7% of patients post-menopausal. Half of our patients had bone-only disease, 45% had visceral metastasis (liver and lung) and 63% presented with endocrine sensitive disease. The estimated median PFS for the whole population was 16.2 months. Median PFS for capecitabine arm was 17.7 months versus 14.6 months for letrozole alone (p = 0.078). Overall response rate was 70% for capecitabine/letrozole arm and 56.6% for letrozole only. Clinical benefit rate was 90% in the capecitabine/letrozole arm versus 73.3% in the letrozole arm. Overall survival data is still immature after this short follow up duration. Adverse event assessment showed acceptable all grade and high grade toxicity profile consistent with the established adverse events of both capecitabine and letrozole. Anaemia (28.3%) and hand & foot syndrome (43.8%) were significantly more common in the capecitabine/letrozole arm. Capecitabine combined with letrozole have showed a trend towards improvement in progression free survival with potential more benefit to certain sub-groups and the combination showed acceptable safety profile consistent with the established known safety profile of both letrozole and capecitabine.",

        "AB": "Objective: To provide supports for the cancer prevention and control strategies in China by comparing the disease burden, epidemic trends, 5-year relative survival rate and major determinants of common cancers between China and the United States. Methods: A descriptive secondary analysis was conducted using data extracted from the GLOBOCAN database, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, Global Burden of disease 2019 database, and previous studies. The main indicators included the cases of malignant tumors in different sites, the cases of deaths, the age-standardized incidence (world standard incidence) and mortality (world standard mortality), the 5-year relative survival rate, and population attributable fraction (PAF). Results: In 2022, an estimated 4.825 million new cases and 2.574 million deaths of malignant neoplasms in China. The world standard incidence rate (201.6/100 000) in China was lower than that in the United States (367.0/100 000), and the world standard mortality rate (96.5/100 000) was higher than that in the United States (82.3/100 000). Lung cancer ranked first in the disease burden of malignant tumors in China, the new cases and deaths accounted for 22.0% and 28.5% of all malignant tumors, respectively. The top three malignant tumors in China were breast cancer (11.5%), prostate cancer (9.7%) and lung cancer (9.5%), which were also among the top five causes of death. However, the second to fifth leading causes of death from malignant tumors in China were digestive system tumors (liver cancer 12.3%, stomach cancer 10.1%, colorectal cancer 9.3%, and esophageal cancer 7.3%). From 2000 to 2018, the world standard incidence of malignant tumors showed an increasing trend and the world standard mortality of malignant tumors showed a decreasing trend in China, while the world standard incidence and mortality of malignant tumors in the United States showed a significant decreasing trend after 2000. The incidence of breast cancer, colorectal cancer and thyroid cancer increased rapidly in China, while the incidence and mortality of stomach cancer, liver cancer and esophageal cancer decreased, but they still had a heavy disease burden. From 2003 to 2015, the overall 5-year relative survival rate of malignant tumors increased from 30.9% to 40.5% in China. However, with the exception of esophageal cancer, the 5-year relative survival rates of other major malignant tumors were lower than those in the United States. In 2019, the PAF of malignant tumors death attributable to potential modifiable risk factors was 48.3% in China, which was similar to the United States (49.8%). Of these, smoking was the most important attributable risk factor, and the PAF was more than 30% both in China and the United States. In addition, about 18.8% of malignant tumors were caused by preventable chronic infections, such as hepatitis B virus and Helicobacter pylori, while less than 4% of malignant tumors in the United States were caused by infection. Conclusions: China has made great progress in the prevention and treatment of malignant tumors, but it still faces a serious disease burden. The cancer spectrum is changing from developing countries to developed countries. We should pay attention to modifiable factors, take comprehensive measures, and prevent cancer scientifically.",

We present a bioprinted breast CSC tumor-stroma model incorporating triple-negative breast CSCs (TNB-CSCs) and stromal cells (human breast fibroblasts), within a breast-derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink. Comparison of molecular signatures in this model with different clinical subtypes of bioprinted tumor-stroma models unveils a unique molecular profile for artificial CSC tumor models. We additionally demonstrate that the model can recapitulate the invasive potential of TNB-CSC. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering imaging allowed us to monitor the invasive potential of tumor cells in deep z-axis planes, thereby overcoming the depth-imaging limitations of confocal fluorescence microscopy. As a proof-of-concept application, we conducted high-throughput drug testing analysis to assess the efficacy of CSC-targeted therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic compounds. The results highlight the usefulness of tumor-stroma models as a promising drug-screening platform, providing insights into therapeutic efficacy against CSC populations resistant to conventional therapies.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of fire dragon cupping in prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in breast cancer. METHODS: Sixty breast cancer patients receiving medium-high emetogenic chemotherapy regimen were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a control group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out). In both groups, 5 mg tropisetron hydrochloride was given intravenously on the day of chemotherapy and 1st to 3rd days after chemotherapy. In the observation group, fire dragon cupping on the abdomen was applied on 1st, 3rd and 5th days after chemotherapy. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, the severity of nausea, vomiting on 1st to 6th days after chemotherapy, and the duration of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite were observed in the two groups. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) score, general comfort questionnaire scale (GCQ) score before and after treatment and remedy antiemetic medication were observed in the two groups, and the safety was evaluated. RESULTS: On 2nd to 6th days after chemotherapy, the number of patients with nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal distension and nausea scores in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). On 1st to 3rd days after chemotherapy, the number of patients with vomiting and vomiting scores in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The duration of nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite in the observation group were shorter than those in the control group (P<0.05). In the observation group, there was no significant difference in SAS and GCQ scores before and after treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, the GCQ score in the control group was decreased compared with that before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, there was no significant difference in SAS and GCQ scores between the two groups (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of patients using remedy medication between the two groups (P>0.05). No adverse reaction occurred during treatment in both groups. CONCLUSION: Fire dragon cupping can effectively reduce the incidence of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and the severity of nausea, vomiting related to chemotherapy in breast cancer, and improve patient comfort, and have good safety.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment and enhancement of health-related skills among oncology patients are pivotal for optimizing cancer care. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), a questionnaire designed to reflect an individual's knowledge, skills, and confidence in self-healthcare management, has been validated across diverse countries and settings. Concerns have been raised regarding the cross-situational applicability, as patients with specific diseases and cultural backgrounds interpret questionnaire items differently. This study aimed to examine the structural validity and psychometric properties of the PAM-13 in an oncological patient cohort. METHODS: Baseline data from a longitudinal non-randomized controlled study involving cancer out-patients (n = 1,125) from Comprehensive Cancer Centres in Southern Germany were analysed. The German version of the PAM-13 was employed. With classical test and item response theory methods data quality, reliability, convergent and structural validity, as well as psychometric properties were assessed. Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were employed to investigate the postulated unidimensionality of the underlying construct. With a partial credit model (PCM) we examined item fit, targeting, local independence and differential item functioning. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly female (73.0%) with a breast cancer diagnosis (41.3%). While items were generally well-accepted, ceiling effects were observed and a high mean PAM-13 score (69.7, SD = 14.2) was noted, potentially compromising responsiveness to interventions. Reliability was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81), person and item separation reliability were good to excellent (0.81 and 0.99, respectively). Explorations of the unidimensionality of the construct (EFA, CFA, PCM) yielded inconclusive results, hinting towards a two-factor solution. Item difficulty rankings deviated from the original. No differential item functioning was identified, and local independence was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: While the PAM-13 serves as a valuable instrument for comprehending and promoting health-related skills in cancer patients, the identification of ceiling effects, disordered item-difficulty rankings, and inconclusive findings regarding unidimensionality contribute to the expanding body of evidence, emphasizing the dependency of PAM-13's validity and reliability on distinctive characteristics within the population under investigation. Future research should prioritize refining or adding PAM-13 items to better capture the specific health-related challenges within diverse populations, paving the way for more effective patient engagement strategies in oncology.

        "AB": "PURPOSE: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are common among individuals with breast cancer (BC) and poorly managed symptoms are associated with reduced quality of life, treatment discontinuation, and poorer breast cancer outcomes. Direct comparisons among therapies are limited, as prior studies evaluating VMS interventions have utilized heterogeneous change measures which may not fully assess the perceived impact of change in VMS severity. METHODS: We performed a prospective study where BC patients chose one of four categories of interventions to manage VMS. Change in VMS severity at 6 weeks was assessed using the validated Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS). A novel weighted change score integrating baseline symptom severity and directionality of change was computed to maximize the correlation between the change score and a perceived treatment effectiveness score. Variables influencing change in VMS severity were included in a regression tree to model factors influencing the weighted change score. RESULTS: 100 baseline and follow-up questionnaires assessing VMS were completed by 88 patients. Correlations between treatment effectiveness and VMS outcomes strengthened following adjustment for baseline symptoms. Patients with low VMS severity at baseline did not perceive change in treatment effectiveness. Intervention category was predictive of change in HFRS at 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: Baseline symptom severity and the directionality of change (improvement or deterioration of symptoms) influenced the perception of clinically meaningful change in VMS severity. Future interventional studies utilizing the weighted change score should target moderate-high baseline severity patients.",

This process was achieved through the ionic gelation technique, aiming to improve the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic moiety by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles (NPs) with a ligand. We coated these NPs with hyaluronic acid (HA) to actively target the CD44 receptor, which is frequently overexpressed in various solid malignancies, including breast cancer. XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM were used for the physicochemical analysis of the NPs. These 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) loaded NPs were evaluated on MDA-MB-231 (a triple-negative breast cell line) and MCF-10A (normal epithelial breast cells) to determine their in vitro efficacy. The developed 5-FU-loaded NPs exhibited a particle size within a favorable range (< 300 nm). The positive zeta potential of these nanoparticles facilitated their uptake by negatively charged cancer cells. Moreover, they demonstrated robust stability and achieved high encapsulation efficiency. These nanoparticles exhibited significant cytotoxicity compared to the crude drug (p < 0.05) and displayed a promising release pattern consistent with the basic diffusion model. These traits improve the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and ability to precisely target these nanoparticles, offering a potentially successful anticancer treatment for breast cancer. However, additional in vivo assessments of these formulations are obligatory to confirm these findings.",

Here, an enzyme-responsive polymeric prodrug with self-assembly properties was synthesized for targeted co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and ursolic acid (UA). Hyaluronic acid (HA) was conjugated with UA, yielding an amphiphilic prodrug with 13.85 mol% UA and a CMC of 32.3 mug/mL. The HA-UA conjugate exhibited  approximately 14 % and 47 % hydrolysis at pH 7.4 and in tumor cell lysate. HA-UA/PTX NPs exhibited a spherical structure with 173 nm particle size, and 0.15 PDI. The nanoparticles showed high drug loading (11.58 %) and entrapment efficiency (76.87 %) of PTX. Release experiments revealed accelerated drug release ( approximately 78 %) in the presence of hyaluronidase enzyme. Cellular uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells showed enhanced uptake of HA-UA/PTX NPs through CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. In vitro, HA-UA/PTX NPs exhibited higher cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and mitochondrial depolarization compared to PTX alone. In vivo, HA-UA/PTX NPs demonstrated improved pharmacokinetic properties, with 2.18, 2.40, and 2.35-fold higher AUC, t(1/2), and MRT compared to free PTX. Notably, HA-UA/PTX NPs exhibited superior antitumor efficacy with a 90 % tumor inhibition rate in 4T1 tumor model and low systemic toxicity, showcasing their significant potential as carriers for TNBC combination therapy.",

Medical imaging is an essential component for diagnosis and guided treatment, which is needed to meet the current challenges of increasing chronic diseases and preparedness for acute-care response. We present some key themes essential for improving global health equity which were discussed at the 2023 RAD-AID Conference on International Radiology and Global Health. They include: (i) capacity-building, (ii) artificial intelligence (AI), (iii) community-based patient navigation, (iv) organizational design for multidisciplinary global health strategy, (v) implementation science, and (vi) innovation. Although not exhaustive, these themes should be considered influential as we guide and expand global health radiology programs in LMICs in the coming years.",

        "AB": "In this study, we have proposed a novel approach that combines hyaluronic acid (HA), folic acid (FA), and celastrol (CLS) within a polymeric micelle system (HF-CLS/MLs), offering a dual-action strategy against breast cancer. Polymeric mixed micelles were prepared through the thin-film hydration method, and comprehensive quality control parameters were established, encompassing particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, surface morphology, encapsulation efficiency, drug content, in vitro drug release, and storage stability assessment. The average particle size of CLS-HF/MLs micelles was found to be 120\u202fnm and their drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies were 15.9\u202f% and 89.52\u202f%, respectively. The in vitro release data showed that the CLS-HF/MLs targeted mixed micelles displayed a prolonged release profile compared to the free drug. Additionally, the stability of the developed polymeric mixed micelles was maintained for up to 8\u202fweeks of storage in terms of particle size and drug content. Furthermore, both flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy studies indicated a significant enhancement in the cellular uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity of CLS-HF/MLs mixed micelles against MCF-7 cell line. In terms of pharmacokinetic analysis, the half-life and AUC values of CLS-HF/MLs mixed micelles were found to be approximately 4.71- and 7.36-folds higher than the values of free drug (CLS), respectively. The CLS-HF/MLs micelles exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy (almost complete ablation of the 4\u202fT1-cell bearing tumor xenografts mouse model) due to the dual receptor (CD44 and folate) targeting effects with minimal side effects. When considering the cumulative findings of our present research, it becomes evident that mixed micelles designed for chemotherapy offer a promising and potentially effective therapeutic avenue for the treatment of breast cancer.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a category of breast cancer characterized with high molecular heterogeneity. Owing to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies, patients with TNBC have a poor prognosis. Paris saponin VII (PS\u2166), a steroidal saponin extracted from the rhizome of Trichillium tschonoskii Maxim, exhibits excellent anti-cancer activity in a variety of solid tumors. However, the role and potential mechanism of PS\u2166 against TNBC remain unexplored. PURPOSE: This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effects of PS\u2166 against TNBC and explore the potential mechanism of action. METHODS: We combined the analysis of public single-cell sequencing data with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identity differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that distinguished malignant and normal epithelial cells in TNBC. Subsequently, the biological features of DEGs in TNBC were evaluated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to define potential pathways associated with the DEGs. The pharmacological activity of PS\u2166 for TNBC was evidenced via in vitro and in vivo experiments, and molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay and western blotting were employed to confirm the relative mechanisms. RESULTS: Single-cell sequencing and WGCNA revealed STMN1 as a pivotal biomarker of TNBC. STMN1 overexpression in TNBC was associated with poor patient prognosis. GSEA revealed a significant accumulation of STMN1 within the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, In vitro experiments showed that PS\u2166 showed significantly suppressive actions on the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities for TNBC cells, while inducing apoptosis. Molecular docking, MD analysis and SPR assay indicated a robust interaction between PS\u2166 and the MEK protein. Western blotting revealed that PS\u2166 may inhibit tumor progression by suppressing the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and the downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STMN1. Intraperitoneal injection of PS\u2166 (10 mg/kg) notably reduced tumor growth by 71.26 % in a 4T1 xenograft model. CONCLUSION: In our study, the systems biology method was used to identify potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated PS\u2166 suppresses cancer progression by targeting the MEK/ERK/STMN1 signaling axis. For the first time, the inhibition of STMN1 phosphorylation has been indicated as a possible mechanism for the anticancer effects of PS\u2166. These results emphasize the potential value of PS\u2166 as a promising anti-cancer drug candidate for further development in the field of TNBC therapeutics.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Multiple Primary Malignant Neoplasms (MPMNs) are rare and refer to the occurrence of two or more distinct primary cancers with unrelated histopathological features in one patient. MPMNs can be classified as synchronous when tumors appear simultaneously or within six months of each other, and as metachronous when identified six months or more after the initial cancer diagnosis. While breast cancer often co-occurs with other primary cancers such as colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, the simultaneous presence of invasive lobular breast carcinoma and clear cell renal cancer is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present the case of a 59-year-old postmenopausal woman who initially presented with breast carcinoma. Further investigation revealed a mass in the left kidney. The patient underwent a radical mastectomy and axillary dissection, followed by a left nephrectomy. After 8 months follow up, the patient is doing well and disease-free. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Based on our case and literature review, the co-occurrence of breast carcinoma with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is uncommon. Most reported cases involve metastatic tumors or metachronous breast malignancy with RCC. The etiology of synchronous malignancy is complex, and treatment options usually include a combination of surgery and/or adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: This case report contributes valuable insights to the limited literature on synchronous breast cancer with renal cell carcinoma. The rarity of this simultaneous occurrence underscores the importance of considering such cases. Documenting these cases is crucial for increasing awareness and reducing the resulting morbidity and mortality.",

        "AB": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors and hence, is therapeutically challenging. Towards this, we studied an alternate therapy by repurposing metformin (FDA-approved type-2 diabetic drug with anticancer properties) in a 3D-scaffold culture, with electrical pulses. 3D cell culture was used to simulate the tumor microenvironment more closely and MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells, treated with both 5 mM metformin (Met) and 8 electrical pulses at 2500 V/cm, 10 micros (EP1) and 800 V/cm, 100 micros (EP2) at 1 Hz were studied in 3D and 2D. They were characterized using cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glucose uptake, and lactate production assays at 24 h. Cell viability, as low as 20 % was obtained with EP1 + 5 mM Met. They exhibited 1.65-fold lower cell viability than 2D with EP1 + 5 mM Met. ROS levels indicated a 2-fold increase in oxidative stress for EP1 + 5 mM Met, while the glucose uptake was limited to only 9 %. No significant change in the lactate production indicated glycolytic arrest and a non-conducive environment for MDA-MB-231 growth. Our results indicate that 3D cell culture, with a more realistic tumor environment that enhances cell death using metformin and electrical pulses could be a promising approach for TNBC therapeutic intervention studies.",

        "AB": "According to the latest cancer research data, there are a significant number of new cancer cases and a substantial mortality rate each year. Although a substantial number of clinical patients are treated with existing cancer drugs each year, the efficacy is unsatisfactory. The incidence is still high and the effectiveness of most cancer drugs remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, we evaluated the human proteins for their causal relationship to for cancer risk and therefore also their potential as drug targets. We used summary tumors data from the FinnGen and cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) data from a genome-wide association study, and employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the association between potential drug targets and nine tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, liver, bladder, prostate, kidney, head and neck, pancreatic caners. Furthermore, we conducted MR analysis on external cohort. Moreover, Bidirectional MR, Steiger filtering, and colocalization were employed to validate the main results. The DrugBank database was used to discover potential drugs of tumors. Under the threshold of False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, results showed that S100A16 was protective protein and S100A14 was risk protein for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER-positive) breast cancer, phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) was risk protein for colorectal cancer, and melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) was protective protein for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). And there was no reverse causal association between them. Colocalization analysis showed that S100A14 (PP.H4.abf = 0.920) and S100A16 (PP.H4.abf = 0.932) shared causal variation with HER-positive breast cancer, and PDE5A (PP.H4.abf = 0.857) shared causal variation with colorectal cancer (CRC). The MR results of all pQTL of PDE5A and MIA were consistent with main results. In addition, the MR results of MIA and external outcome cohort were consistent with main results. In this study, genetic predictions indicate that circulating S100 calcium binding protein A14 (S100A14) and S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) are associated with increase and decrease in the risk of HER-positive breast cancer, respectively. Circulating PDE5A is associated with increased risk of CRC, while circulating MIA is associated with decreased risk of NSCLC. These findings suggest that four proteins may serve as biomarkers for cancer prevention and as potential drug targets that could be expected for approval.",

        "AB": "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image-based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model's decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.",

A prospective study was conducted on 392 women who underwent breast cancer surgery at Hangzhou Cancer Hospital from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022. Operable breast cancer patients who had completed all treatments except endocrine therapy were included. Patients with tumor recurrence/metastasis, bilateral or male breast cancer, and other primary malignancies were excluded. After enrollment, patients were asked to complete the BREAST-Q scale, and their pathological and medical records were reviewed. Analysis of variance was used to compare the quality of life scores among the groups. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify independent factors associated with quality of life scores in different domains. Participants completed the BREAST-Q scale at a median of 4.6 years after surgery. Quality of life scores varied based on the therapeutic strategy. Breast conservation has significant advantages over mastectomy in terms of breast satisfaction, psychosocial, and sexual well-being. Compared to oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery, mastectomy was independently associated with decreased breast satisfaction, psychosocial, and sexual well-being, while conventional breast-conserving surgery showed comparable outcomes to oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in terms of these factors. Breast conservation leads to an improvement in quality of life compared to mastectomy. Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery does not lead to a decrease in quality of life compared to conventional breast-conserving surgery and offers better outcomes compared to mastectomy.",

        "AB": "Fulvestrant, as the first selective estrogen receptor degrader, is widely used in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer. However, in the real world, there is a lack of relevant reports on adverse reaction data mining for fulvestrant. To perform data mining on adverse events (AEs) associated with fulvestrant and explore the risk factors contributing to severe AEs, providing a reference for the rational use of fulvestrant in clinical practice. Retrieved adverse event report information associated with fulvestrant from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from market introduction to September 30, 2023. Suspicious AEs were screened using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio methods based on disproportionality analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on severe AEs to explore the risk factors associated with fulvestrant-induced severe AEs. A total of 6947 reports related to AEs associated with fulvestrant were obtained, including 5924 reports of severe AEs and 1023 reports of non-severe AEs. Using the disproportionality analysis method, a total of 210 valid AEs were identified for fulvestrant, with 45 AEs (21.43%) not listed in the product labeling, involving 11 systems and organs. The AEs associated with fulvestrant were sorted by frequency of occurrence, with neutropenia (325 cases) having the highest number of reports. By signal strength, injection site pruritus showed the strongest signal (ROR = 658.43). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that concurrent use of medications with extremely high protein binding (>/= 98%) is an independent risk factor for severe AEs associated with fulvestrant. Age served as a protective factor for fulvestrant-related AEs. The co-administration of fulvestrant with CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors did not show statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of severe AEs. Co-administration of drugs with extremely high protein binding (>/= 98%) may increase the risk of severe adverse reactions of fulvestrant. Meanwhile, age (60-74 years) may reduce the risk of severe AEs of fulvestrant. However, further clinical research is still needed to explore and verify whether there is interaction between fulvestrant and drugs with high protein binding through more clinical studies.",

        "AB": "The immune system is complicated, interconnected, and offers a powerful defense system that protects its host from foreign pathogens. Immunotherapy involves boosting the immune system to kill cancer cells, and nowadays, is a major emerging treatment for cancer. With the advances in our understanding of the immunology of cancer, there has been an explosion of studies to develop and evaluate therapies that engage the immune system in the fight against cancer. Nevertheless, conventional therapies have been effective in reducing tumor burden and prolonging patient life, but the overall efficacy of these treatment regimens has been somewhat mixed and often with severe side effects. A common reason for this is the activation of molecular mechanisms that lead to apoptosis of anti-tumor effector cells. The competency to block tumor escape entirely depends on our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways which operate in the tumor microenvironment. Numerous strategies have been developed for activating the immune system to kill tumor cells. Breast cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death in women, and is characterized by complex molecular and cellular events that closely intertwine with the host immune system. In this regard, predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy, use of nanotechnology, personalized cancer vaccines, antibodies to checkpoint inhibitors, engineered chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, and the combination with other therapeutic modalities have transformed cancer therapy and optimized the therapeutic effect. In this chapter, we will offer a holistic view of the different therapeutic modalities and recent advances in immunotherapy. Additionally, we will summarize the recent advances and future prospective of breast cancer immunotherapies, as a case study.",

        "AB": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer sub-type with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Currently, standard treatments for TNBC includes surgery, chemotherapy, and anti-PDL1 therapy. These therapies have limited efficacy in advanced stages. Myeloid-cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family protein. High expression of MCL1 contributes to chemotherapy resistance and is associated with worse prognosis in TNBC. MCL1 inhibitors are in clinical trials for TNBC, but response rates to these inhibitors can vary and predictive markers are lacking. Currently we identified a 4-member (AXL, ETS1, IL6, EFEMP1) gene signature (GS) that predicts MCL1 inhibitor sensitivity in TNBC cells. Factors encoded by these genes regulate signaling pathways to promote MCL1 inhibitor resistance. Small molecule inhibitors of the GS factors can overcome resistance and sensitize otherwise resistant TNBC cells to MCL1 inhibitor treatment. These findings offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies and tumor stratification for MCL1 inhibitor use in TNBC.",

        "AB": "Homologous recombination (HR) plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability, and the efficiency of the HR system is closely associated with tumor response to chemotherapy. Our previous work reported that CK2 kinase phosphorylates HTATSF1 Ser748 (pS748) to facilitate HTATSF1 interaction with TOPBP1, which in turn, promotes RAD51 recruitment and HR repair. However, the clinical implication of the CK2-HTATSF1-TOPBP1 pathway in tumorigenesis and chemotherapeutic response remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that the CK2-HTATSF1-TOPBP1 axis is generally hyperactivated in multiple malignancies and renders breast tumors less responsive to chemotherapy. In contrast, deletion mutations of each gene in this axis, which also occur in breast and lung tumor samples, predict higher HR deficiency (HRD) scores, and tumor cells bearing a loss-of-function mutation of HTATSF1 are vulnerable to PARP inhibitors (PARPis) or platinum drugs. Taken together, our study suggests that the integrity of the CK2-HTATSF1-TOPBP1 axis is closely linked to tumorigenesis, and serves as an indicator of tumor HR status and modulates chemotherapy response.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women. Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) is one of the main components extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Angelica sinensis. Research has shown that ASP affects the progression of various cancers by regulating miRNA expression. This study aimed to explore the specific molecular mechanism by which ASP regulates BC progression through miR-3187-3p. After the overexpression or knockdown of miR-3187-3p and PDCH10 in BC cells, the proliferation, migration, invasion, and phenotype of BC cells were evaluated after ASP treatment. Bioinformatics software was used to predict the target genes of miR-3187-3p, and luciferase gene reporter experiments reconfirmed the targeted binding relationship. Subcutaneous tumor formation experiments were conducted in nude mice after the injection of BC cells. Western blot and Ki-67 immunostaining were performed on the tumor tissues. The results indicate that ASP can significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells. ASP can inhibit the expression of miR-3187-3p in BC cells and upregulate the expression of PDCH10 by inhibiting miR-3187-3p. A regulatory relationship exists between miR-3187-3p and PDCH10. ASP can inhibit the expression of beta-catenin and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (p-GSK-3beta) proteins through miR-3187-3p/PDCH10 and prevent the occurrence of malignant biological behavior in BC. Overall, this study revealed the potential mechanism by which ASP inhibits the BC process. ASP mediates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by affecting the miR-3187-3p/PDCH10 molecular axis, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, migration, invasion, and other malignant biological behaviors of BC cells.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves all individuals attaining accessible health interventions at an affordable cost. We examined current patterns and temporal trends of cancer mortality and UHC across sociodemographic index (SDI) settings, and quantified these association. METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 and Our World in Data. The UHC effective coverage index was obtained to assess the potential population health gains delivered by health systems. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to quantify the trend of cancer age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR). A generalized linear model was applied to estimate the association between ASMR and UHC. FINDINGS: The high (EAPC = -0.9% [95% CI, -1.0%, -0.9%]) and high-middle (-0.9% [-1.0%, -0.8%]) SDI regions had the fastest decline in ASMR (per 100,000) for total cancers from 1990 to 2019. The overall UHC effective coverage index increased by 27.9% in the high-SDI quintile to 62.2% in the low-SDI quintile. A negative association was observed between ASMR for all-cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.87 [0.76, 0.99]), stomach (0.73 [0.56, 0.95]), breast (0.64 [0.52, 0.79]), cervical (0.42 [0.30, 0.60]), lip and oral cavity (0.55 [0.40, 0.75]), and nasopharynx (0.42 [0.26, 0.68]) cancers and high UHC level (the lowest as the reference). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strengthen the evidence base for achieving UHC to improve cancer outcomes.

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Hormone Receptor-positive (HR+) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer is the most common subtype, predominantly treated with endocrine therapy. The efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy in this context remains to be fully evaluated. MATERIALS (OR PATIENTS) AND METHODS: This study compared the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and ribociclib) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant against endocrine therapy alone in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. The main focus was on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The study involved a population treated exclusively with endocrine therapy for bone involvement, examining median OS and PFS, and adjusting for variables like stage, visceral metastasis, age, and treatment line. RESULTS: The study found no significant OS difference between treatments with palbociclib, ribociclib, and endocrine therapy alone. However, ribociclib combined with letrozole significantly improved PFS over letrozole alone. Propensity score weighting indicated a potential 50 % reduction in death risk with ribociclib compared to palbociclib, though this was not confirmed by cox regression. CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitors, particularly ribociclib in combination with letrozole, show promise in improving outcomes for HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. While palbociclib may not be superior to traditional endocrine therapy, the results underscore the need for further research. These findings could influence future treatment protocols, emphasizing the importance of personalized therapy in this patient group.",

Palladacycles have shown excellent promise as demonstrated by our previous work which yielded BTC2, a binuclear palladadycle with a non-ionisable polyethylene glycol (PEG) tether. Here, we explore the importance of the PEG-tether length on the anticancer activity of the binuclear palladacycles by comparing three analogous binuclear palladacycles, BTC2, BTC5 and BTC6, in the oestrogen receptor positive MCF7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. In addition, these are compared to another analogue with an ionisable morpholine tether, BTC7. Potent anticancer activity was revealed through cell viability studies (MTT assays) revealed that while BTC6 showed similar potent anticancer activity as BTC2, it was less toxic towards non-cancerous cell lines. Interestingly, BTC7 and BTCF were less potent than the PEGylated palladacycles but showed significantly improved selectivity towards the triple-negative breast cancer cells. Cell death analysis showed that BTC7 and BTCF significantly induced apoptosis in both the cancer cell lines while the PEGylated complexes induced both apoptosis and secondary necrosis. Furthermore, experimental and computational DNA binding studies indicated partial intercalation and groove binding as the modes of action for the PEGylated palladacycles. Similarly, experimental and computational BSA binding studies indicated and specific binding sites in BSA dependent on the nature of the tethers on the complexes.",

        "AB": "Although progress has been made in the treatment of cancer, particularly for the four major types of cancers affecting the lungs, colon, breast and prostate, resistance to cancer treatment often emerges upon inhibition of major signaling pathways, which leads to the activation of additional pathways as a last-resort survival mechanism by the cancer cells. This signaling plasticity provides cancer cells with a level of operational freedom, reducing treatment efficacy. Plasticity is a characteristic of cancer cells that are not only able to switch signaling pathways but also from one cellular state (differentiated cells to stem cells or vice versa) to another. It seems implausible that the inhibition of one or a few signaling pathways of heterogeneous and plastic tumors can sustain a durable effect. We propose that inhibiting molecules with pleiotropic functions such as cell surface co-receptors can be a key to preventing therapy escape instead of targeting bona fide receptors. Therefore, we ask the question whether co-receptors often considered as \"accessory molecules\" are an overlooked key to control cancer cell behavior.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed tumour, representing nearly 30% of all new cases in women. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role in the management of breast cancer. The objective of this study is to assess modesty in patients undergoing RT for breast cancer and take their suggestions and ideas into consideration to enhance the quality of treatment in this regard. METHODS: The study enrolled 555 breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant RT in three Italian centres. Patients completed a self-test questionnaire assessing their comfort level concerning modesty during therapy and their relationship with strangers and healthcare professionals. The impact of religious views and potential changes in sexuality were also examined. RESULTS: Results showed that modesty was a common concern across the overall cohort of patients, with discomfort in being undressed during RT correlating with discomfort experienced in other daily life situations. Most patients felt more at ease with same sex healthcare workers. Age was also a major factor with younger patients generally feeling more comfortable with healthcare workers of the same age group. Interestingly, the surgical technique used (mastectomy vs. quadrantectomy) did not significantly influence modesty perceptions. Patients provided valuable suggestions to improve privacy and modesty during RT. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that modesty is an important issue for women undergoing RT, which can be influenced by personal characteristics and hospital-related factors. A reflection about the need to address modesty concerns and to incorporate dedicated interventions for protecting patients' physical and emotional well-being is warranted. Initiatives to improve communication, involvement, and body image support should also be integrated into the care path of patients to better their overall therapeutic experience. This study paves the way for broader research and interventions in daily cancer care.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of gradient pressure therapy on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and improvement in activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Eighty female patients with breast cancer treated at Tangshan People's Hospital between October 2022 and July 2023 were selected as research participants and divided into control and intervention, with 40 patients in each group. The control group received routine treatment and care, whereas the intervention group received gradient pressure therapy based on routine treatment and care. Incidence of peripheral neuropathy and the degree of impact on ADL between the two groups were compared after the intervention for cycles 2, 4, and 6. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the general information between the two groups (P > 0.05). After two intervention cycles, there was no significant difference in the incidence of CIPN, various dimensions of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool (CIPNAT), and total scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). After four intervention cycles, the two groups had a statistically significant difference in the incidence of CIPN, sensory dimension, general activity dimension, and total CIPNAT score (P < 0.05). After six intervention cycles, there was a significant difference in the incidence of CIPN, sensory dimension, fine activity dimension, general activity dimension, and total CIPNAT score between the two groups (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in the other dimensions (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gradient pressure therapy can effectively prevent or alleviate peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy and improve their ability to perform ADL. Thus, it is safe, effective, and worthy of clinical application. TRIAL REGISTRATION: RMYY-LLKS-2022-054.",

        "AB": "Breast cancers of either ductal or lobular pathology make up the vast majority of breast malignancies. Other cancers occur rarely in the breast. Benign pathology can at times mimic breast cancers on imaging and initial needle biopsies. We report a rare breast pathology of cylindroma. Cylindromas are usually benign, rare dermatologic lesions most commonly associated with head or neck locations. They more commonly occur as sporadic and solitary masses. Less commonly is an autosomal-dominant multi-centric form of this disease. Malignant cylindromas are very rare. We present a patient with findings of a cylindroma of the breast after excision. This was initially felt to be concerning for breast cancer on imaging and core biopsy. Treatment of cylindromas of the breast is excision. Sentinel lymph node dissection is not indicated, nor are adjuvant therapies when identified in the breast. This lesion needs to be included in the differential diagnosis for breast cancer. If cylindromas can be accurately diagnosed preoperatively, this would negate the need for consideration of axillary nodal surgery and adjuvant therapies.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PureCyTonin against hot flashes (HF) in breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Italy. INTERVENTIONS: administration of PureCyTonin or placebo, for 3 months. Effectiveness was investigated through the compilation of a daily diary for HF and of validated questionnaires (Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Visual Analogical Scales (VAS) for HF, sweating, irritability, fatigue, sleep, quality of life), carried out before starting the treatment (T0), after 1 month (T1) and after 3 months (T2). Any side effects and HF diary were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: 19 women were randomized to receive PureCyTonin and 20 to placebo. At T2 compared to T0, in the PureCyTonin group, we found a reduction in the number of HF (p = 0.02) measured by daily diary. An improvement in the subjective perception of women regarding HF intensity (p = 0.04), sweat nuisance (p = 0.02), irritability (p = 0.03) and fatigue (p = 0.04) was observed through VAS scale measurement at T2 compared to T0.The total MRS score was significantly better in the PureCyTonin group at T1 (p = 0.03) compared to T0. CONCLUSIONS: PureCyTonin significantly reduces HF number after 3 months of therapy in BCS and it is well-tolerated.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: With proper beam setup and optimization constraints in the treatment planning system, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can improve target dose coverage and conformity while reducing doses to adjacent structures for whole breast radiation therapy. However, the low-dose bath effect on critical structures, especially the heart and the ipsilateral lung, remains a concern. In this study, we present a VMAT technique with the jaw offset VMAT (JO-VMAT) to reduce the leakage and scatter doses to critical structures for whole breast radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 10 left breast cancer patients were retrospectively used for this study. CT images were acquired on a CT scanner (GE, Discovery) with the deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique. The planning target volumes (PTVs) and the normal structures (the lungs, the heart, and the contralateral breast) were contoured on the DIBH scan. A 3D field-in-field plan (3D-FiF), a tangential VMAT (tVMAT) plan, and a JO-VMAT plan were created with the Eclipse treatment planning system. An arc treatment field with the x-jaw closed across the central axis creates a donut-shaped high-dose distribution and a cylinder-shaped low-dose volume along the central axis of gantry rotation. Applying this setup with proper multi-leaf collimator (MLC) modulation, the optimized plan potentially can provide sufficient target coverage and reduce unnecessary irradiation to critical structures. The JO-VMAT plans involve 5-6 tangential arcs (3 clockwise arcs and 2-3 counterclockwise arcs) with jaw offsets. The plans were optimized with objective functions specified to achieve PTV dose coverage and homogeneity; For organs at risk (OARs), objective functions were specified individually for each patient to accomplish the best achievable treatment plan. For tVMAT plans, optimization constraints were kept the same except that the jaw offset was removed from the initial beam setup. The dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters were generated for dosimetric evaluation of PTV and OARs. RESULTS: The D(95%) to the PTV was greater than the prescription dose of 42.56 Gy for all the plans. With both VMAT techniques, the PTV conformity index (CI) was statistically improved from 0.62 (3D-FiF) to 0.83 for tVMAT and 0.84 for JO-VMAT plans. The difference in the homogeneity index (HI) was not significant. The D(max) to the heart was reduced from 12.15 Gy for 3D-FiF to 8.26 Gy for tVMAT and 7.20 Gy for JO-VMAT plans. However, a low-dose bath effect was observed with tVMAT plans to all the critical structures including the lungs, the heart, and the contralateral breast. With JO-VMAT, the V(5Gy) and V(2Gy) of the heart were reduced by 32.7% and 15.4% compared to 3D-FiF plans. Significantly, the ipsilateral lung showed a reduction in mean dose (4.65-3.44 Gy) and low dose parameters (23.4% reduction for V(5Gy) and 10.7% reduction for V(2Gy)) for JO-VMAT plans compared to the 3D-FiF plans. The V(2Gy) dose to the contralateral lung and breast was minimal with JO-VMAT techniques. CONCLUSION: A JO-VMAT technique was evaluated in this study and compared with 3D-FiF and tVMAT techniques. Our results showed that the JO-VMAT technique can achieve clinically comparable coverage and homogeneity and significantly improve dose conformity within PTV. Additionally, JO-VMAT eliminated the low-dose bath effect at all OARs evaluation metrics including the ipsilateral/contralateral lung, the heart, and the contralateral breast compared to 3D-FiF and tVMAT. This technique is feasible for the whole breast radiation therapy of left breast cancers.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors are disproportionately at risk for cardiovascular disease; exercise-based interventions may improve cardiovascular health. The objective of this formative research is to better understand the needs of patients and barriers to participation in an adapted cardiac rehabilitation program for diverse breast cancer survivors in an urban safety net setting. METHODS: We recruited 30 participants (10 English-speaking, 10 Spanish-speaking, and 10 Cantonese-speaking) who had received treatment with curative intent for breast cancer from an urban safety net hospital between November 9, 2021, to August 30, 2022. Participants completed surveys and interviews about perspectives on health behaviors and participating in an adapted cardiac rehabilitation program. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed using rapid template analysis with pre-selected constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, as well as emergent codes. We developed a Participant User Journey for a program based on responses and conducted human-centered design sessions with 8 participants to iteratively revise the Participant User Journey. RESULTS: Among 30 participants, mean age was 56.7 years (standard deviation [SD] 10.2) with 100% female sex assigned at birth; 1 participant withdrew before completing study procedures. Most participants had limited health literacy (18/29, 62%). Mean body mass index was 31.4 (SD 8.3), 21/29 (72%) had blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg, and 12/29 (41%) had blood pressure below 130/80. Mean 6-minute walk distance was 384.9 meters (SD 78.3). The desired benefits of a program included healthy living and prevention of cancer recurrence. Barriers to participation included motivation, social support, transportation, and concerns about exercise safety. Participants emphasized the need for practicality, such as fitting physical activity into daily life and nutrition support, including recipes and shopping lists. Trusted experts and cultural and language concordance were viewed as important aspects of the program. CONCLUSIONS: Through participant interviews and human-centered design sessions, we developed the HEART-ACT program, a 12-week multi-disciplinary program addressing physical activity, nutrition, emotional well-being, cardiovascular risk, survivorship, and other components if indicated (e.g., tobacco cessation). Future research will test the effects of this program on patient-centered outcomes.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine the impact of the loco-regional treatment modality, on the loco-regional recurrence (LRR) rates and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients younger than 40 years. METHODS: Data of 623 breast cancer patients younger than 40 years of age were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified according to the locoregional treatment approach into three groups: the mastectomy group (M), the mastectomy followed by radiation therapy group (MRX) and the breast conservative therapy group (BCT). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 72 months (range, 6-180). Two hundred and nine patients were treated with BCT, 86 with MRM and 328 with MRX. The 10-year rate LRR rates according to treatment modality were: 13.4% for BCT, 15.1% for MRM and 8.5% for MRX (p 0.106). On univariate analysis, T stage (p 0.009), AJCC stage (p 0.047) and Her 2 status (p 0.001) were associated with LRR. Ten-year overall survival (OS) was 72.7% (78.5% in the BCT group, 69.8% in the MRM group and 69.8% in the MRX group, p 0.072). On Univariate analysis, age < 35 (p 0.032), grade III (p 0.001), N3 stage (p 0.001), AJCC stage III (p 0.005), ER negative status (0.04), Her 2-status positive (0.006) and lack of chemotherapy administration (p 0.02) were all predictors of increased mortality. CONCLUSION: For patients younger than 40 years of age, similar LRR and overall survival outcomes were achieved using BCT, M or MRX. Young age at diagnosis should not be used alone in recommending one loco-regional treatment approach over the others.",

        "AB": "Identifying cancer risk groups by multi-omics has attracted researchers in their quest to find biomarkers from diverse risk-related omics. Stratifying the patients into cancer risk groups using genomics is essential for clinicians for pre-prevention treatment to improve the survival time for patients and identify the appropriate therapy strategies. This study proposes a multi-omics framework that can extract the features from various omics simultaneously. The framework employs autoencoders to learn the non-linear representation of the data and applies tensor analysis for feature learning. Further, the clustering method is used to stratify the patients into multiple cancer risk groups. Several omics were included in the experiments, namely methylation, somatic copy-number variation (SCNV), micro RNA (miRNA) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from two cancer types, including Glioma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma from the TCGA dataset. The results of this study are promising, as evidenced by the survival analysis and classification models, which outperformed the state-of-the-art. The patients can be significantly (p-value<0.05) divided into risk groups using extracted latent variables from the fused multi-omics data. The pipeline is open source to help researchers and clinicians identify the patients' risk groups using genomics.",

Nevertheless, the impact of TRIM-targeted antibacteria on tumor inhibition and immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unexplored. Herein, we report long-term relapse-free survival by coordinating antibacteria with antitumor treatment, addressing the aggravated immunosuppression and tumor overgrowth induced by TRIM using breast and prostate cancer models. Combining Ag(+) release with a Fenton-like reaction and photothermal conversion, simultaneous bacteria killing and multimodal antitumor therapy are enabled by a single agent. Free of immune-stimulating drugs, the agent restores antitumor immune surveillance and activates immunological responses. Secondary inoculation and distal tumor analysis confirm lasting immunological memory and systemic immune responses. A relapse-free survival of >700 days is achieved. This work unravels the crucial role of TRIM-targeted antibacteria in tumor inhibition and unlocks an unconventional route for immune regulation in TME and a complete cure for cancer.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) have poor prognosis and survival outcomes. Sacituzumab govitecan was newly approved into Chinese market for mTNBC. However, whether its price matches the survival benefit still needs exploring. Here, this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacituzumab govitecan versus chemotherapy in patients with mTNBC from the perspective of Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: A partitioned survival model consisting of three discrete health states was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacituzumab govitecan versus single-agent chemotherapy. The key clinical data in the model were from the ASCENT trial. Costs and utility inputs were collected from published literatures. Life-years gained, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net health benefits, and incremental net monetary benefits were calculated between 2 treatment strategies. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty and verify model robustness. Subgroup and cost-threshold analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Sacituzumab govitecan provided an additional 0.25 QALYs and an incremental cost of $ 81,778.61 compared with chemotherapy, which was associated with an ICER of $ 323,603.84/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the model was most sensitive to the cost of sacituzumab govitecan, weight, and utility of progression-free survival. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the probability of sacituzumab govitecan being cost-effective was 0%. Considering a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 3 times GDP, the maximum cost of sacituzumab govitecan that would make it cost-effective was $155.65 per unit (180 mg). CONCLUSIONS: Sacituzumab govitecan was not cost-effective for patients with mTNBC compared with chemotherapy at the commonly adopted WTP threshold of 3 times GDP per capita per QALY in China.",

Cervical cancer screening approaches have evolved from cytology (Papanicolaou test) to highly sensitive HPV-based molecular methods and personalized, risk-stratified, management guidelines. Innovations like self-collection of samples to increase screening access, innovative triage methods to optimize management of screen positives, and scalable and efficacious precancer treatment approaches will be key to further enhance the utility of prevention interventions.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: The administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may lead to renal adverse events, notably including renal dysfunction. To early predict the probability of renal dysfunction after ICIs therapy, a retrospective case-control study was conducted. METHODS: Clinical information on ICIs-treated patients was collected. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify risk factors for renal dysfunction after ICIs treatment. Moreover, a nomogram model was developed and validated internally. RESULTS: A total of 442 patients were included, among which 35 (7.9%) experienced renal dysfunction after ICIs treatment. Lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR 0.941; 95% CI 0.917 to 0.966; p<0.001), concurrent exposure of platinum(OR 4.014; 95% CI 1.557 to 10.346; p=0.004), comorbidities of hypertension (OR 3.478; 95% CI 1.600 to 7.562; p=0.002) and infection (OR 5.402; 95% CI 1.544 to 18.904; p=0.008) were found to be independent associated with renal dysfunction after ICIs treatment. To develop a predictive nomogram for the occurrence of renal dysfunction after ICIs treatment, the included cases were divided into training and validation groups in a ratio of 7:3 randomly. The above four independent risk factors were included in the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the predictiive model were 0.822 (0.723-0.922) and 0.815 (0.699-0.930) in the training and validation groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lower baseline eGFR, platinum exposure, comorbidities of hypertension and infection were predictors of renal dysfunction in ICIs-treated patients with cancer. A nomogram was developed to predict the probability of renal dysfunction after ICIs treatment, which might be operable and valuable in clinical practice.",

        "AB": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpressed mutidrug resistance (MDR) is currently a key factor limiting the effectiveness of breast cancer chemotherapy. Systemic administration based on P-gp-associated mechanism leads to severe toxic side effects. Here, we designed a T7 peptide-modified mixed liposome (T7-MLP@DTX/SchB) that, by active targeting co-delivering chemotherapeutic agents and P-gp inhibitors, harnessed synergistic effects to improve the treatment of MDR breast cancer. This study established drug-resistant cell models and animal models. Subsequently, comprehensive evaluations involving cell uptake, cell apoptosis, cellular toxicity assays, in vivo tumor-targeting capability, and anti-tumor activity assays were conducted to assess the drug resistance reversal effects of T7-MLP@DTX/SchB. Additionally, a systematic assessment of the biosafety profile of T7-MLP@DTX/SchB was executed, including blood profiles, biochemical markers, and histopathological examination. It was found that this co-delivery strategy successfully exerted the synergistic effects, since there was a significant tumor growth inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant breast cancer. Targeted modification with T7 peptide enhanced the therapeutic efficacy remarkably, while vastly ameliorating the biocompatibility compared to free drugs. The intriguing results supported the promising potential use of T7-MLP@DTX/SchB in overcoming MDR breast cancer treatment.",

        "AB": "Two frequent problems hindering clinical translation of nanomedicine are low drug loading and low colloidal stability. Previous efforts to achieve ultrahigh drug loading (>30 %) introduce new hurdles, including lower colloidal stability and others, for clinical translation. Herein, we report a new class of drug nano-carriers based on our recent finding in protein-nanoparticle co-assembly supraparticle (PNCAS), with both ultrahigh drug loading (58 % for doxorubicin, i.e., DOX) and ultrahigh colloidal stability (no significant change in hydrodynamic size after one year). We further show that our PNCAS-based drug nano-carrier possesses a built-in environment-responsive drug release feature: once in lysosomes, the loaded drug molecules are released instantly (<1 min) and completely ( approximately 100 %). Our PNCAS-based drug delivery system is spontaneously formed by simple mixing of hydrophobic nanoparticles, albumin and drugs. Several issues related to industrial production are studied. The ultrahigh drug loading and stability of DOX-loaded PNCAS enabled the delivery of an exceptionally high dose of DOX into a mouse model of breast cancer, yielding high efficacy and no observed toxicity. With further developments, our PNCAS-based delivery systems could serve as a platform technology to meet the multiple requirements of clinical translation of nanomedicines.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is widely used for the treatment of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and for contraception. However, the association between the use of LNG-IUD and the risk of site-specific gynecologic and breast cancers remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We aim to address this knowledge gap by investigating whether the use of LNG-IUD is associated with a significant risk of site-specific gynecologic and breast cancers. This will be achieved by accessing the nationwide Swedish Registers, with consideration given to the influence and potential interaction of family history of cancer. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 514719 women aged 18 to 50 years who have used LNG-IUD between July 2005 and December 2018 were identified from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and randomly matched with 1544157 comparisons who did not use LNG-IUD at a ratio of 1:3. The propensity score was calculated and matched among women who used LNG-IUD and the matched comparisons. The follow-up period started from the date of the first prescription of LNG-IUD for users as well as for their matched comparisons and ended at the date of diagnosis of gynecologic and breast cancers, date of death from any cause, and the end of the study period, whichever came first. The Cox proportional hazard model with a competing risk analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Additive interaction was calculated as the relative excess risk for interaction, while multiplicative interaction was calculated by including a product term in the regression model. RESULTS: The use of LNG-IUD was associated with a 13% higher risk of breast cancer (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.10-1.17), a 33% lower risk of endometrial cancer (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.80), a 14% lower risk of ovarian cancer (adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99) and a 9% reduced risk of cervical cancer (adjusted HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99) compared to women who did not use LNG-IUD. A significant additive interaction between LNG-IUD use and family history of cancer was observed in breast cancer, indicating a relative 19% excess risk for interaction (P < 0.002), and 1.63 additional cases per 10,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of gynecologic and breast cancers exhibits a site-specific effect among LNG-IUD users. It's important to note that the observed effect is small for breast cancer and the results are limited by the observational study design. Clinical recommendations regarding the use of LNG-IUD should carefully weigh its potential benefits and risks. Close monitoring is advisable for the potential development of breast cancer, particularly among women with a family history of breast cancer.",

The consistent improvements of outcomes set a high bar for new drug development and the need to explore new ways to overcome resistance mechanisms. Emerging treatments in HER2-positive breast cancer aim to tackle the disease by acting on different targets, including not only HER2 (both at the extra- and intracellular level), but also HER3, PD-(L)1, CTLA4, NKG2A, AKT, PI3K, and, in triple-positive tumors, the estrogen receptors and the cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6. This review describes the evolving treatment landscape of HER2-positive breast cancer, from the current approved therapies to the future perspectives, with a focus on the new agents which are likely to get approved in the next future.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this population-based cohort study was to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) compared to adjuvant chemotherapy in prognosis among patients with HR+/HER2 negative breast cancer. METHOD: This population-based study utilized data from the research database BCBaSe 3.0, based on the Swedish National Quality breast cancer register, including all patients with breast cancer diagnosis in Sweden between 2008 and 2019. Propensity score matching approach was applied. The outcomes of interest consisted of distant-disease free (DDFS), breast-cancer specific (BCSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 14 459 patients were included in the study cohort of whom 2086 received NACT. After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 1539 patients in each study group were available for analyses. No statistically significant difference in survival outcomes were observed between patients treated with NACT compared to those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (Hazard Ratio (HR) for DDFS: 1.20; 95 % CI: 0.80-1.79; HR for BCSS: 1.16; 95 % CI: 0.54-2.49; HR for OS: 1.14; 95 % CI: 0.64-2.05). CONCLUSION: In this population-based cohort study of patients with HR+/HER2-breast cancer, the use of NACT seems to be comparable to adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of prognosis, although non-inferiority cannot be proven by this study design. Until further evidence suggesting a survival benefit in favor of either treatment is available, NACT can be pursued when surgical-de-escalation is intended.",

        "AB": "HYPOTHESIS: Multicore flower-like iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are among the best candidates for magnetic hyperthermia applications against cancers. However, they are rarely investigated in physiological environments and their efficacy against cancer cells has been even less studied. The combination of magnetic hyperthermia, using multicore IONPs, with selected bioactive molecules should lead to an enhanced activity against cancer cells. EXPERIMENTS: Multicore IONPs were synthesized by a seeded-growth thermal decomposition approach. Then, the cytotoxicity, cell uptake, and efficacy of the magnetic hyperthermia approach were studied with six cancer cell lines: PANC1 (pancreatic carcinoma), Mel202 (uveal melanoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), MB231 (triple-negative breast cancer line), A549 (lung cancer), and HCT116 (colon cancer). Finally, IONPs were modified with a chemotherapeutic drug (SN38) and tumor suppressor microRNAs (miR-34a, miR-182, let-7b, and miR-137), to study their activity against cancer cells with and without combination with magnetic hyperthermia. FINDINGS: Two types of multicore IONPs with very good heating abilities under magnetic stimulation have been prepared. Their concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and internalization have been established, showing a strong dependence on the cell line and the nanoparticle type. Magnetic hyperthermia causes significant cell death that is dramatically enhanced in combination with the bioactive molecules.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine how considerations specific to older adults impact between- and within-surgeon variation in axillary surgery use in women >/=70 years with T1N0 HR+ breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Females >/=70 years with T1N0 HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer diagnosed from 2013 to 2015 in SEER-Medicare were identified and linked to the American Medical Association Masterfile. The outcome of interest was axillary surgery. Key patient-level variables included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, frailty (based on a claims-based frailty index score), and age (>/=75 vs <75). Multilevel mixed models with surgeon clusters were used to estimate the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) (between-surgeon variance), with 1-ICC representing within-surgeon variance. RESULTS: Of the 4410 participants included, 6.1% had a CCI score of >/=3, 20.7% were frail, and 58.3% were >/= 75 years; 86.1% underwent axillary surgery. No surgeon omitted axillary surgery in all patients, but 42.3% of surgeons performed axillary surgery in all patients. In the null model, 10.5% of the variance in the axillary evaluation was attributable to between-surgeon differences. After adjusting for CCI score, frailty, and age in mixed models, between-surgeon variance increased to 13.0%. DISCUSSION: In this population, axillary surgery varies more within surgeons than between surgeons, suggesting that surgeons are not taking an \"all-or-nothing\" approach. Comorbidities, frailty, and age accounted for a small proportion of the variation, suggesting nuanced decision-making may include additional, unmeasured factors such as differences in surgeon-patient communication.",

METHODS: This study is a narrative review of the potential of massage as breast cancer prevention through stress and immune system mechanisms. RESULTS: Massage is able to prevent chronic stress through improved sleep and fatigue and lower stress levels. Prevention of chronic stress will maximize the function of cells that eliminate cancer cells, such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and improve the balance of Foxp3 Tregulator cells. Partnered delivery massage will bring effective benefits for stress reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Massage can provide indirect prevention of breast cancer, and partnered delivery massage can be a good choice to reduce stress.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Indonesian civilization extensively uses traditional medicine to cure illnesses and preserve health. The lack of knowledge on the security and efficacy of medicinal plants is still a significant concern. Although the precise chemicals responsible for this impact are unknown, ginger is a common medicinal plant in Southeast Asia that may have anticancer qualities. METHOD: Using data from Dudedocking, a machine-learning model was created to predict possible breast anticancer chemicals from ginger. The model was used to forecast substances that block KIT and MAPK2 proteins, essential elements in breast cancer. RESULT: Beta-carotene, 5-Hydroxy-74'-dimethoxyflavone, [12]-Shogaol, Isogingerenone B, curcumin, Trans-[10]-Shogaol, Gingerenone A, Dihydrocurcumin, and demethoxycurcumin were all superior to the reference ligand for MAPK2, according to molecular docking studies. Lycopene, [8]-Shogaol, [6]-Shogaol, and [1]-Paradol exhibited low toxicity and no Lipinski violations, but beta carotene had toxic predictions and Lipinski violations. It was anticipated that all three substances would have anticarcinogenic qualities. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study shows the value of machine learning in drug development and offers insightful information on possible anticancer chemicals from ginger.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Fat transfer has been widely used after breast conservative surgery (BCS) where it aims to recover shapes as a simple, inexpensive, biocompatible method but the technique is not without complications. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a promising approach to enhance fat graft survival and subsequently improve the outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of enriching fat graft with PRP for delayed correction of deformities after conservative surgery for breast cancer regarding esthetic outcome and incidence of complications. METHODS: The current study included 50 female patients who were scheduled for delayed lipofilling for correction of deformities after conservative surgery for breast cancer. The studied patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups: Group I (G I) included 25 patients scheduled for PRP enriched lipoinjection and Group II (G II) included 25 patients scheduled for lipoinjection without PRP as a control group. RESULTS: Number of sessions of lipoinjection was significantly less in G I in comparison to G II (P = 0.024). During the 2nd session; the amounts of fat injected and harvested were significantly less in G I in comparison to G II (P = 0.049 and 0.001 respectively). Recipient site complications were significantly more evident in G II in comparison to G I (P = 0.01). Surgeon and patient satisfactions were significantly more evident in GI in comparison to G II (P = 0.005 and 0.029 respectively). CONCLUSION: The addition of PRP to fat grafts is a simple, cost-effective and safe method to improve esthetic outcome and decrease complications.",

        "AB": "With the growing utilization and expanding role of breast MRI, breast imaging radiologists may encounter an increasing number of incidental findings beyond the breast and axilla. Breast MRI encompasses a large area of anatomic coverage extending from the lower neck to the upper abdomen. While most incidental findings on breast MRI are benign, identifying metastatic disease can have a substantial impact on staging, prognosis, and treatment. Breast imaging radiologists should be familiar with common sites, MRI features, and breast cancer subtypes associated with metastatic disease to assist in differentiating malignant from benign findings. Furthermore, detection of malignancies of nonbreast origin as well as nonmalignant, but clinically relevant, incidental findings can significantly impact clinical management and patient outcomes. Breast imaging radiologists should consistently follow a comprehensive search pattern and employ techniques to improve the detection of these important incidental findings.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that tumour cell death can be enhanced 10- to 40-fold when radiotherapy is combined with focussed ultrasound-stimulated microbubble (FUS-MB) treatment. The acoustic exposure of microbubbles (intravascular gas microspheres) within the target volume causes bubble cavitation, which induces perturbation of tumour vasculature and activates endothelial cell apoptotic pathways responsible for the ablative effect of stereotactic body radiotherapy. Subsequent irradiation of a microbubble-sensitised tumour causes rapid increased tumour death. The study here presents the mature safety and efficacy outcomes of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided FUS-MB (MRgFUS-MB) treatment, a radioenhancement therapy for breast cancer. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This prospective, single-center, single-arm Phase 1 clinical trial included patients with stages I-IV breast cancer with in situ tumours for whom breast or chest wall radiotherapy was deemed adequate by a multidisciplinary team (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04431674). Patients were excluded if they had contraindications for contrast-enhanced MR or microbubble administration. Patients underwent 2 to 3 MRgFUS-MB treatments throughout radiotherapy. An MR-coupled focussed ultrasound device operating at 800 kHz and 570 kPa peak negative pressure was used to sonicate intravenously administrated microbubbles within the MR-guided target volume. The primary outcome was acute toxicity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Secondary outcomes were tumour response at 3 months and local control (LC). A total of 21 female patients presenting with 23 primary breast tumours were enrolled and allocated to intervention between August/2020 and November/2022. Three patients subsequently withdrew consent and, therefore, 18 patients with 20 tumours were included in the safety and LC analyses. Two patients died due to progressive metastatic disease before 3 months following treatment completion and were excluded from the tumour response analysis. The prescribed radiation doses were 20 Gy/5 fractions (40%, n = 8/20), 30 to 35 Gy/5 fractions (35%, n = 7/20), 30 to 40 Gy/10 fractions (15%, n = 3/20), and 66 Gy/33 fractions (10%, n = 2/20). The median follow-up was 9 months (range, 0.3 to 29). Radiation dermatitis was the most common acute toxicity (Grade 1 in 16/20, Grade 2 in 1/20, and Grade 3 in 2/20). One patient developed grade 1 allergic reaction possibly related to microbubbles administration. At 3 months, 18 tumours were evaluated for response: 9 exhibited complete response (50%, n = 9/18), 6 partial response (33%, n = 6/18), 2 stable disease (11%, n = 2/18), and 1 progressive disease (6%, n = 1/18). Further follow-up of responses indicated that the 6-, 12-, and 24-month LC rates were 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] [84%, 100%]), 88% (95% CI [75%, 100%]), and 76% (95% CI [54%, 100%]), respectively. The study's limitations include variable tumour sizes and dose fractionation regimens and the anticipated small sample size typical for a Phase 1 clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS-MB is an innovative radioenhancement therapy associated with a safe profile, potentially promising responses, and durable LC. These results warrant validation in Phase 2 clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04431674.",

In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms acquired for crizotinib in MET-amplified lung carcinoma cell lines. Two MET-amplified lung cancer cell lines, EBC-1 and H1993, were established for acquired resistance to MET-TKI crizotinib and were functionally elucidated. Genomic and transcriptomic data were used to assess the factors contributing to the resistance mechanism, and the alterations hypothesized to confer resistance were validated. Multiple mechanisms underlie acquired resistance to crizotinib in MET-amplified lung cancer cell lines. In EBC-1-derived resistant cells, the overexpression of SERPINE1, the gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), mediated the drug resistance mechanism. Crizotinib resistance was addressed by combination therapy with a PAI-1 inhibitor and PAI-1 knockdown. Another mechanism of resistance in different subline cells of EBC-1 was evaluated as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. In H1993-derived resistant cells, MEK inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance with downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. In this study, we revealed the different mechanisms of acquired resistance to the MET inhibitor crizotinib with potential therapeutic application in patients with MET-amplified lung carcinoma.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become increasingly important for breast cancer survivors, but clinically relevant declines often persist for many years after treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether social relationships can mitigate or prevent this decline in HRQOL. METHODS: Data were used from the German population-based Mamma Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation (MARIE) cohort of 2022 breast cancer cases with follow-up information for more than 15 years after diagnosis. Correlations between social integration, social support, and global health status (GHS) as an overall measure of HRQOL were analyzed, and linear regression analysis was performed with structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported high levels of social integration and social support and moderate levels of GHS. Social integration 5 years after diagnosis was associated with GHS 5 years after diagnosis (beta = 1.12; 95% CI, 0.25-1.99), but no longitudinal effects were found. Social support 5 years after diagnosis was associated with better GHS 5 years (beta = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.36-0.48) and 10 years after diagnosis (beta = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.22), whereas social support 10 years after diagnosis was associated with GHS 10 years (beta = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.20-0.39) and 15 years after diagnosis (beta = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.21). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that social relationships positively influence HRQOL in long-term breast cancer survivors and that their association should receive more attention clinically and beyond routine care.",

        "AB": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) presents cells with challenges such as variable pH, hypoxia, and free radicals, triggering stress responses that affect cancer progression. In this study, we examine the stress response landscape in four carcinomas-breast, pancreas, ovary, and prostate-across five pathways: heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and unfolded protein stress. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we create an atlas of stress responses across various types of carcinomas. We find that stress responses vary within the TME and are especially active near cancer cells. Focusing on the non-immune stroma we find, across tumor types, that NRF2 and the oxidative stress response are distinctly activated in immune-regulatory cancer-associated fibroblasts and in a unique subset of cancer-associated pericytes. Our study thus provides an interactome of stress responses in cancer, offering ways to intersect survival pathways within the tumor, and advance cancer therapy.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy and mastectomy are currently offered as equivalent surgical options for early-stage breast cancer based on RCTs from the 1970s and 1980s. However, the treatment of breast cancer has evolved and recent observational studies suggest a survival advantage for breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to summarize the contemporary evidence regarding survival after breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy versus mastectomy for women with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase that identified studies published between 1 January 2000 and 18 December 2023 comparing overall survival after breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy versus mastectomy for patients with unilateral stage 1-3 breast cancer was undertaken. The main exclusion criteria were studies evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy, rare breast cancer subtypes, and specific breast cancer populations. The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess risk of bias, with the overall certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Studies without critical risk of bias were included in a quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 11 750 abstracts, 108 eligible articles were identified, with one article including two studies; 29 studies were excluded from the meta-analysis due to an overall critical risk of bias, 42 studies were excluded due to overlapping study populations, and three studies were excluded due to reporting incompatible results. A total of 35 observational studies reported survival outcomes for 909 077 patients (362 390 patients undergoing mastectomy and 546 687 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy). The pooled HR was 0.72 (95% c.i. 0.68 to 0.75, P < 0.001), demonstrating improved overall survival for patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy. The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence suggesting a survival advantage for women undergoing breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer compared with mastectomy. Although these results should be interpreted with caution, they should be shared with patients to support informed surgical decision-making.",

        "AB": "IMPORTANCE: Oral endocrine treatments have been shown to be effective when carefully adhered to. However, in patients with early breast cancer, adherence challenges are notable, with 17% experiencing nonpersistence and 41% nonadherence at least once. OBJECTIVE: To model the persistence of and adherence to oral anticancer treatment of a patient with localized breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted using anonymous reimbursement data belonging to French female patients with breast cancer, extracted from the French Health Insurance database from January 2013 to December 2018. Data analysis was conducted from January 2021 to May 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the detection of episodes of nonpersistence and nonadherence 6 months before they happened. Adherence was defined as the ratio between the time covered by a drug purchase and the time between 2 purchases; patients were considered nonadherent if the ratio of their next 3 purchases was less than 80%. Disparities in persistence and adherence based on criteria such as age, treatment type, and income were identified. RESULTS: A total of 229\u202f695 female patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [52-72] years) with localized breast cancer were included. A deep learning model based on a gated-recurrent unit architecture was used to detect episodes of nonpersistence or nonadherence. This model demonstrated an area under the receiving operating curve of 0.71 for persistence and 0.73 for adherence. Analyzing the Shapley Additive Explanations values also gave insights into the contribution of the different features over the model's decision. Patients older than 70 years, with past nonadherence, taking more than 1 treatment in the previous 3 months, and with low income had greater risk of episodes of nonpersistence. Age and past nonadherence, including regularity of past adherence, were also important features in the nonadherence model. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found associations of patient age and past adherence with nonpersistence or nonadherence. It also suggested that regular intervals in treatment purchases enhanced adherence, in contrast to irregular purchasing patterns. This research offers valuable tools for improving persistence of and adherence to oral anticancer treatment among patients with early breast cancer.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer has emerged as the most widespread and dangerous type of malignancy among women worldwide. Postbiotics have recently emerged as a promising novel adjunct in breast cancer therapy, due to their immunomodulatory effects and the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of conventional treatments. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of postbiotics derived from Lactobacillus brevis (CSF2) and Lactobacillus casei (CFS5), specifically examining their ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the current study, the anticancer activity of the cell-free supernatant of L. brevis and L. casei was investigated against MCF-7 cells using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR technique. Both bacteria showed a high potential for the induction of cell death in MCF-7 cells. However, CFS2 cytotoxicity was significantly higher than CFS5. Flow cytometry results showed significant induction of early apoptosis in cells treated with both CFS2 and CFS5 within 48 h. The induction was notably higher in cells treated with CFS2 compared to CFS5. Overall, CFS2 therapy resulted in a greater increase in BAX and CASP9 gene expression, as well as an elevated BAX/BCL2 ratio within 48 h. These findings indicate that the CFS2 treatment showed a higher level of apoptotic activity than the CFS5 treatment. High biocompatibility was demonstrated following treatment with CFS2 and CFS5. These CFSs may serve as adjunctive medications for suppressing the proliferation of cancer cells. The results of the current study highlight the potential of postbiotics in cancer treatment and suggest that supernatants may serve as effective agents for suppressing cancer cell growth and viability.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: This article aims to examine how psychological resilience influences the interplay between quality of life and post-traumatic growth among breast cancer patients receiving follow-up care and treatment in Turkiye. METHODS: The study involved 119 female individuals diagnosed with breast cancer who visited the Oncology outpatient clinic at a state hospital in Turkiye from January to September 2023. Data were gathered through the administration of a survey form and the utilization of several assessment tools, including the Adult Life Quality Scale in Cancer Survivors (QLACS), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Data analysis was carried out using SPSS 25 software. RESULTS: The participants demonstrated an inverse correlation between Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) and two QLACS sub-dimensions, namely recurrence and family concern. Conversely, a positive association was identified between PTG and the advantages of dealing with cancer. Furthermore, a statistically significant positive association was established between BRS and all QLACS sub-dimensions, except for family concern and appearance. However, it was determined that psychological resilience did not act as a moderator in the relationship between PTG and QLACS. CONCLUSION: It is important to enhance psychological resilience in women who have survived cancer at all stages of the cancer journey, including the years after treatment, to have a positive impact on post-traumatic growth and quality of life.",

        "AB": "Epigenetic deregulation is strongly associated with tumour progression. The identification of natural tumour suppressors to overcome cancer metastasis is urgent for cancer therapy. We investigate whether myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukaemia translocated (MLLT) family members contribute to breast cancer progression and found that high MLLT6 expression predicted a better prognosis and that gradually decreased MLLT6 expression was accompanied by breast cancer malignancy. MLLT6 was downregulated by hypoxia-induced enrichment of DNMT1 at the MLLT6 promoter. The results of in vitro functional experiments indicated that MLLT6 depletion promoted colony formation and cell migration, probably by hampering apoptosis. RNA profiling revealed that the apoptotic pathway was downregulated following stable knockdown of MLLT6. DNA damage-inducible transcript 3/4 (DDIT3/4) were among the top 10 downregulated genes and may have expression patterns similar to that of MLLT6. Restoring DDIT3/4 expression in cells with MLLT6 depletion blocked colony formation and cell migration and attenuated the successful colonization of breast cancer cells in vivo. We also determined that the transcription factor activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) is a binding partner of MLLT6 and participates in the MLLT6/ATF2 axis, which was reinforced by inhibition of AKT signalling, in turn inducing DDIT3/4 expression by establishing an active chromatin structure at the DDIT3/4 gene promoters. Because MLLT6 promotes breast cancer cell apoptosis by inducing DDIT3/4 expression during metastasis, it could be a novel tumour suppressor. Implications: Control of MLLT6 expression via inhibition of PI3K/AKT kinase activity is a potential therapeutic approach for the management of metastatic breast cancer.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue and its associated symptoms of sleep disorder and depression are prevalent in cancer survivors especially among breast, lung, and colorectal cancer survivors. While there is no gold standard for treating cancer-related fatigue currently, studies of mind-body exercises such as Qigong have reported promise in reducing symptoms. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and effect of Guolin Qigong on cancer-related fatigue and other symptoms in breast, lung and colorectal cancer survivors while exploring their perceptions and experiences of Guolin Qigong intervention. METHODS: This is an open-label randomized controlled trial with 60 participants divided into 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive 12 weeks of Guolin Qigong intervention with a 4-week follow-up while control will receive usual care under waitlist. The primary outcome will be feasibility measured based on recruitment and retention rates, class attendance, home practice adherence, nature, and quantum of missing data as well as safety. The secondary subjective outcomes of fatigue, sleep quality and depression will be measured at Week-1 (baseline), Week-6 (mid-intervention), Week-12 (post-intervention), and Week-16 (4 weeks post-intervention) while an objective 24-hour urine cortisol will be measured at Week-1 (baseline) and Week-12 (post-intervention). We will conduct a semi-structured interview individually with participants within 3 months after Week-16 (4 weeks post-intervention) to obtain a more comprehensive view of practice adherence. DISCUSSION: This is the first mixed-method study to investigate the feasibility and effect of Guolin Qigong on breast, lung, and colorectal cancer survivors to provide a comprehensive understanding of Guolin Qigong's intervention impact and participants' perspectives. The interdisciplinary collaboration between Western Medicine and Chinese Medicine expertise of this study ensures robust study design, enhanced participant care, rigorous data analysis, and meaningful interpretation of results. This innovative research contributes to the field of oncology and may guide future evidence-based mind-body interventions to improve cancer survivorship. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12622000688785p), was approved by Medical Research Ethic Committee of University Malaya Medical Centre (MREC ID NO: 2022323-11092) and recognized by Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee (RH15124).",

        "LID": "10.1089/jicm.2023.0777 [doi]",
        "AB": "Objectives: Several studies have indicated that dietary interventions may offer protection against the development of cardiac damage in the case of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). The goal of this study was to assess whether an evidence-based cardioprotective diet can be effective in preventing AIC in patients with breast cancer. Design: Randomized, open-label, controlled trial. The study period was set for 18 weeks, and the data were analyzed by generalized estimating equation modeling and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Setting/Location: Shahid Rajaie Hospital affiliated (Tehran, Iran). Subjects: Fifty anthracycline-treated patients with breast cancer. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either a 2-hour training in evidence-based cardio-protective diet or Carvedilol 6.25 mg bid. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the number of patients with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 18 weeks. Results: At week 18, 12 (48%) out of 25 participants in the cardioprotective diet group had abnormal LVEF in comparison with 21 (84%) out of 25 in the carvedilol group (p = 0.007). Also, 2 (8%) out of 25 in the cardioprotective diet group compared with 7 (28%) out of 25 participants in the carvedilol group had abnormal global longitudinal strain (p = 0.066). The diet group showed significant improvements in the quality-of-life dimensions named \"health change\" and \"general health\" compared with the carvedilol group using the Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire. Conclusions: This study suggests that an evidence-based cardioprotective diet can contribute to the prevention of AIC. Although current treatments for AIC can be effective, further research is mandatory for more options.",

        "AB": "Delineation of cardiac substructures is crucial for a better understanding of radiation-related cardiotoxicities and to facilitate accurate and precise cardiac dose calculation for developing and applying risk models. This review examines recent advancements in cardiac substructure delineation in the radiation therapy (RT) context, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current level of knowledge, challenges and future directions in this evolving field. Imaging used for RT planning presents challenges in reliably visualising cardiac anatomy. Although cardiac atlases and contouring guidelines aid in standardisation and reduction of variability, significant uncertainties remain in defining cardiac anatomy. Coupled with the inherent complexity of the heart, this necessitates auto-contouring for consistent large-scale data analysis and improved efficiency in prospective applications. Auto-contouring models, developed primarily for breast and lung cancer RT, have demonstrated performance comparable to manual contouring, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of cardiac delineation practices. Nevertheless, several key concerns require further investigation. There is an unmet need for expanding cardiac auto-contouring models to encompass a broader range of cancer sites. A shift in focus is needed from ensuring accuracy to enhancing the robustness and accessibility of auto-contouring models. Addressing these challenges is paramount for the integration of cardiac substructure delineation and associated risk models into routine clinical practice, thereby improving the safety of RT for future cancer patients.",

We assessed The anti-cancer effects of a mixed ligand Ni(II) complex on human breast and lung cancer cell lines in the current investigation. Mononuclear mixed ligand octahedral Ni(II) complex [NiIIL(NO3)(MeOH)] complex(1), with tri-dentate phenol-based ligand 2,4-dichloro-6-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)phenol (HL) along with  methanol and nitrate as ancillary ligand was prepared.  Piperazine moiety of the ligand exists as boat conformation in this complex as revealed from single crystal X-ray study. UV -visible spectrum of complex (1) exhibits three distinct d-d bands due to spin-allowed 3A2g-->3T1g(P), 3A2g-->3T1g(F) and 3A2g-->3T2g(F) transitions as expected octahedral d8 system. Complex (1) through transactivation of p53 and its pro-apoptotic downstream targets induce apoptotic cell death in mouse and human cancer cells such as mcf-7, A549 and MDA-MB-231 in dose dependent manner. Furthermore, complex (1) was able to slow the migratory rate of MDA-MB-231 cells' in vitro as well as epithelia -mesenchymal transition (EMT), the key step for metastatic transition and malignancy. Over all our results suggest complex (1) as potential agent in anti-tumor treatment regimen both as cytotoxic and anti-metastatic agent against malignant neoplasia.",

        "AB": "Metabolic alterations in cancers can be exploited for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. This is exemplified by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), an imaging tool that relies on enhanced glucose uptake by tumors for diagnosis and staging. By performing transcriptomic analysis of breast cancer (BC) samples from patients stratified by FDG-PET, a 54-gene signature (PETsign) is identified that recapitulates FDG uptake. PETsign is independently prognostic of clinical outcome in luminal BCs, the most common and heterogeneous BC molecular subtype, which requires improved stratification criteria to guide therapeutic decision-making. The prognostic power of PETsign is stable across independent BC cohorts and disease stages including the earliest BC stage, arguing that PETsign is an ab initio metabolic signature. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of BC cells reveals that PETsign predicts enhanced glycolytic dependence and reduced reliance on fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, coamplification of PETsign genes occurs frequently in BC arguing for their causal role in pathogenesis. CXCL8 and EGFR signaling pathways feature strongly in PETsign, and their activation in BC cells causes a shift toward a glycolytic phenotype. Thus, PETsign serves as a molecular surrogate for FDG-PET that could inform clinical management strategies for BC patients.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer poses the significance of early diagnosis and treatment. Here, we developed an innovative photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor characterized by high-level dual photocurrent signals and exceptional sensitivity. The PEC sensor, denoted as MIL&Ag(2)S, was constructed by incorporating Ag(2)S into a metal-organic framework of MIL-101(Cr). This composite not only enhanced electron-hole separation and conductivity but also yielded robust and stable dual photocurrent signals. Through the implementation of signal switching, we achieved the combined detection of cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with outstanding stability, reproducibility, and specificity. The results revealed a linear range for CEA detection spanning 0.01-32 ng/mL, with a remarkably low detection limit of 0.0023 ng/mL. Similarly, for CA15-3 detection, the linear range extended from 0.1 to 320 U/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.014 U/mL. The proposed strategy introduces new avenues for the development of highly efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly PEC sensors. Furthermore, it holds promising prospects for early clinical diagnosis, contributing to potential breakthroughs in medical detection and ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for approximately 1% of all tumors; however, DFSP of the breast is extremely rare. Moreover, DFSP generally has a low malignant potential and is characterized by a high rate of local recurrence along with a small but definite risk of metastasis. The risk of metastasis is higher in fibrosarcomatous transformation in DFSP than in ordinary DFSP. CASE REPORT: We have, herein, reported a case of a 61-year-old male patient with fibrosarcomatous transformation in DFSP. Preoperative Dynamic Contrastenhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) of the breast revealed an oval-shaped mass with heterogeneous internal enhancement, a large vessel embedded within, and a washout curve pattern on kinetic curve analysis. The mass exhibited a hyperintense signal on Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI), with a low apparent diffusion coefficient value. Histologically, the bland spindle tumor cells were arranged in a storiform pattern. Areas with the highest histological grade demonstrated increased cellularity, cytological atypia, and mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, Ki-67 and p53 were highly expressed. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the risk and accurately diagnosing fibrosarcomatous transformation in male breast DFSP are critical for improving prognosis and establishing appropriate treatment and follow-up plans. This emphasizes the significance of combining immunohistopathological features with DCE-MRI and DWI to assist clinicians in the early and accurate diagnosis of sarcomas arising from male breast DFSP.",

        "AB": "Physiological stress such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may contribute normal fibroblasts activation into cancer\u2011associated fibroblasts, which serve a crucial role in certain types of cancer such as pancreatic, breast, liver and lung cancer. The present study aimed to examine the cytoprotective effects of luteolin (3',4',5,7\u2011tetrahydroxyflavone) against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))\u2011generated oxidative stress in lung fibroblasts. To examine the effects of luteolin against H(2)O(2)\u2011induced damages, cell viability, sub\u2011G(1) cell population, nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342, lipid peroxidation and comet assays were performed. To evaluate the effects of luteolin on the protein expression level of apoptosis, western blot assay was performed. To assess the antioxidant effects of luteolin, detection of ROS using H(2)DCFDA staining, O(2)\u2011 and .OH using electron spin resonance spectrometer and antioxidant enzyme activity was performed. In a cell\u2011free chemical system, luteolin scavenges superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase and the Fenton reaction (FeSO(4)/H(2)O(2)). Furthermore, Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79\u20114) treated with H(2)O(2) showed a significant increase in cellular ROS. Intracellular ROS levels and damage to cellular components such as lipids and DNA in H(2)O(2)\u2011treated cells were significantly decreased by luteolin pretreatment. Luteolin increased cell viability, which was impaired following H(2)O(2) treatment and prevented H(2)O(2)\u2011mediated apoptosis. Luteolin suppressed active caspase\u20119 and caspase\u20113 levels while increasing Bcl\u20112 expression and decreasing Bax protein levels. Additionally, luteolin restored levels of glutathione that was reduced in response to H(2)O(2). Moreover, luteolin enhanced the activity and protein expressions of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase\u20111. Overall, these results indicated that luteolin inhibits H(2)O(2)\u2011mediated cellular damage by upregulating antioxidant enzymes.",

        "AB": "The rise in global cancer burden, notably breast cancer, emphasizes the need to address chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, also known as chemobrain. Although chemotherapy drugs are effective against cancer, they can trigger cognitive deficits. This has triggered the exploration of preventive strategies and novel therapeutic approaches. Nanomedicine is evolving as a promising tool to be used for the mitigation of chemobrain by overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with innovative drug delivery systems. Polymer and lipid-based nanoparticles enable targeted drug release, enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. Utilizing the intranasal route of administration may facilitate drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) by circumventing first-pass metabolism. Therefore, knowledge of nasal anatomy is critical for optimizing drug delivery via various pathways. Despite challenges, nanoformulations exhibit the potential in enhancing brain drug delivery. Continuous research into formulation techniques and chemobrain mechanisms is vital for developing effective treatments. The intranasal administration of nanoformulations holds promise for improving therapeutic outcomes in chemobrain management. This review offers insights into potential future research directions, such as exploring novel drug combinations, investigating alternative delivery routes, or integrating emerging technologies to enhance the efficacy and safety of nanoformulations for chemobrain management.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Romiplostim is used to treat chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in a variety of tumor types; however, few studies have examined its use in breast and gynecologic cancers. We evaluated platelet response and durability of response to romiplostim in patients with gynecologic or breast cancer complicated by chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with gynecologic or breast cancer who received romiplostim between 07/1/2021-07/31/2022 at an academic cancer center. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria; 26 (79 %) had breast cancer, 4 (12 %) had ovarian cancer, and 3 (9 %) had endometrial cancer. Twenty patients (61 %) experienced treatment delays and 12 (36 %) required dose reductions prior to starting romiplostim for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, with some patients experiencing both. Eleven patients (33 %) did not undergo a dose reduction or delay prior to initiation of romiplostim. Median platelet count prior to romiplostim therapy was 53 k/mcL (range, 40.5-78.8). Median platelet count within 3 weeks following initiation of romiplostim was 147 k/mcL (range, 31-562). Twenty-one patients (64 %) achieved platelet correction within 3 weeks, of whom 10 (48 %) resumed anticancer therapy and maintained platelet levels above 100 k/mcL at 8 weeks. Twelve patients did not achieve platelet correction within 3 weeks of romiplostim initiation; 4 (33 %) required a treatment change secondary to persistent thrombocytopenia, 3 (25 %) required a treatment dose reduction, 3 (25 %) were deemed too ill to continue therapy, and 2 (17 %) required a treatment delay. CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim facilitated the resumption of anticancer therapy in 64 % of patients with gynecologic or breast cancer complicated by chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To identify the characteristics, indications, and toxicities among patients receiving proton beam therapy (PBT) in the final year of life at an academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who received PBT within the final 12 months of life was performed. Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient and treatment details from 2010 to 2019. Patients were followed from the start of PBT until death or last follow-up. Acute (3 months) toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Imaging response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The chi(2) test was used to evaluate factors associated with palliative treatment. Simple logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with toxicity. RESULTS: Bet299 patients were treated at the end of life (EOL) out of 5802 total patients treated with PBT (5.2%). Median age was 68 years (19-94 years), 58% male. The most common cancer was nonsmall cell lung cancer (27%). Patients were treated for symptom palliation alone (11%), durable control (57%), curative intent (16%), local recurrence (14%), or oligometastatic disease (2%). Forty-five percent received reirradiation. Median treatment time was 32 days (1-189 days). Acute toxicity was noted in 85% of the patients (31% G1, 53% G2, 15% G3). Thirteen patients (4%) experienced chronic toxicity. Breast and hematologic malignancy were associated with palliative intent chi(2) (1, N = 14) = 17, P = .013; (chi(2) (1, N = 14) = 18, P = .009). CONCLUSION: The number of patients treated with PBT at the EOL was low compared to all comers. Many of these patients received treatment with definitive doses and concurrent systemic therapy. Some patients spent a large portion of their remaining days on treatment. A prognostic indicator may better optimize patient selection for PBT at the EOL.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: In breast cancer, improved treatment approaches that reduce injury to lung tissue and early diagnosis and intervention for lung toxicity are increasingly important in survivorship. The aims of this study are to (1) compare lung tissue radiographic changes in women treated with conventional photon radiation therapy and those treated with proton therapy (PT), (2) assess the volume of lung irradiated to 5 Gy (V5) and 20 Gy (V20) by treatment modality, and (3) quantify the effects of V5, V20, time, and smoking history on the severity of tissue radiographic changes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study of female breast cancer patients was conducted to monitor postradiation subclinical lung tissue radiographic changes. Repeated follow-up x-ray computed tomography scans were acquired through 2 years after treatment. In-house software was used to quantify an internally normalized measure of pulmonary tissue density change over time from the computed tomography scans, emphasizing the 6- and 12-month time points. RESULTS: Compared with photon therapy, PT was associated with significantly lower lung V5 and V20. Lung V20 (but not V5) correlated significantly with increased subclinical lung tissue radiographic changes 6 months after treatment, and neither correlated with lung effects at 12 months. Significant lung tissue density changes were present in photon therapy patients at 6 and 12 months but not in PT patients. Significant lung tissue density change persisted at 12 months in ever-smokers but not in never-smokers. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with PT had significantly lower radiation exposure to the lungs and less statistically significant tissue density change, suggesting decreased injury and/or improved recovery compared to photon therapy. These findings motivate additional studies in larger, randomized, and more diverse cohorts to further investigate the contributions of treatment modality and smoking regarding the short- and long-term radiographic effects of radiation on lung tissue.",

Proton beam therapy was used in 0.5%, 1.5%, and 8.9% of breast, lung, and prostate cases. Proton beam therapy was correlated with a farther distance traveled and longer start time from diagnosis for each site (P < .05).For breast, demographic correlates of PBT were treatment in the west coast (odds ratio [OR] = 4.81), age <60 (OR = 1.25), white race (OR = 1.94), and metropolitan area (OR = 1.58). Left-sided cancers (OR = 1.28), N2 (OR = 1.71), non-ER+/PR+/Her2Neu- cancers (OR = 1.24), accelerated partial breast irradiation (OR = 1.98), and hypofractionation (OR = 2.35) were predictors of PBT.For nonsmall cell cancer, demographic correlates of PBT were treatment in the south (OR = 2.6), metropolitan area (OR = 1.72), and Medicare insurance (OR = 1.64). Higher comorbid score (OR = 1.36), later year treated (OR = 3.16), and hypofractionation (not SBRT) (OR = 3.7) were predictors of PBT.For prostate, correlates of PBT were treatment in the west coast (OR = 2.48), age <70 (OR = 1.19), white race (OR = 1.41), metropolitan area (OR = 1.25), higher income/education (OR = 1.25), and treatment at an academic center (OR = 33.94). Lower comorbidity score (OR = 1.42), later year treated (OR = 1.37), low-risk disease (OR = 1.45), definitive compared to postoperative (OR = 6.10), and conventional fractionation (OR = 1.64) were predictors of PBT. CONCLUSION: Even for facilities with established referrals to proton centers, PBT utilization was low; socioeconomic status was potentially a factor. Proton beam therapy was more often used with left-sided breast and low-risk prostate cancers, without a clear clinical pattern in lung cancer.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) treatment only relies on the standard treatment of nonspecific invasive breast cancer (NSIBC), and it remains controversial whether the survival of patients improves. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the clinicopathological features of IMPC and to investigate the factors affecting its prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 104 IMPC patients who met the study's inclusion criteria out of a total of 4,532 patients with invasive breast cancer between January 2015 and December 2019. A contemporaneous cohort of 230 patients with non-specific invasive breast cancer (NSIBC) who underwent surgery was identified and matched using propensity scores. RESULTS: The survival rate for patients with IMPC ranged from 1.12% to 7.03%. Statistically significant differences were observed in the proportion of endocrine treatment, lymphatic invasion, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive rate, molecular subtypes, molecular typing, and 5-year loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) between the two cohorts (p < 0.05). The univariate analysis showed that T stage, N stage, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, ER-positive rate, and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative rate were all prognosis risk factors (p < 0.05) for IMPC. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis indicated that lymphatic invasion and N stage were independent prognostic factors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of micropapillary IMPC, among other pathological subtypes, is steadily increasing. ER-positive and PR-positive rates, as well as luminal subtypes, are frequent, with a concurrent increase in the 5-year locoregional recurrence rate. It would be interesting to compare the effect following these therapeutic modifications in larger cohorts in future studies.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify precise biomarkers for breast cancer to improve patient outcomes, addressing the limitations of traditional staging in predicting treatment responses. METHODS: Our analysis encompassed data from over 7,000 breast cancer patients across 14 datasets, which included in-house clinical data and single-cell data from 8 patients (totaling 43,766 cells). We utilized an integrative approach, applying 10 machine learning algorithms in 54 unique combinations to analyze 100 existing breast cancer signatures. Immunohistochemistry assays were performed for empirical validation. The study also investigated potential immunotherapies and chemotherapies. RESULTS: Our research identified five consistent glutamine metabolic reprogramming (GMR)-related genes from multi-center cohorts, forming the foundation of a novel GMR-model. This model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting recurrence and mortality risks compared to existing clinical and molecular features. Patients classified as high-risk by the model exhibited poorer outcomes. IHC validation in 30 patients reinforced these findings, suggesting the model's broad applicability. Intriguingly, the model indicates a differential therapeutic response: low-risk patients may benefit more from immunotherapy, whereas high-risk patients showed sensitivity to specific chemotherapies like BI-2536 and ispinesib. CONCLUSIONS: The GMR-model marks a significant leap forward in breast cancer prognosis and the personalization of treatment strategies, offering vital insights for the effective management of diverse breast cancer patient populations.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a key element of treatment for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Predicting the response to NAC for patients with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (LABC) before treatment initiation could be beneficial to optimize therapy, ensuring the administration of effective treatments. The objective of the work here was to develop a predictive model to predict tumor response to NAC for LABC using deep learning networks and computed tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several deep learning approaches were investigated including ViT transformer and VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Res-Net-101, Res-Net-152, InceptionV3 and Xception transfer learning networks. These deep learning networks were applied on CT images to assess the response to NAC. Performance was evaluated based on balanced_accuracy, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity classification metrics. A ViT transformer was applied to utilize the attention mechanism in order to increase the weight of important part image which leads to better discrimination between classes. RESULTS: Amongst the 117 LABC patients studied, 82 (70%) had clinical-pathological response and 35 (30%) had no response to NAC. The ViT transformer obtained the best performance range (accuracy = 71 +/- 3% to accuracy = 77 +/- 4%, specificity = 86 +/- 6% to specificity = 76 +/- 3%, sensitivity = 56 +/- 4% to sensitivity = 52 +/- 4%, and balanced_accuracy=69 +/- 3% to balanced_accuracy=69 +/- 3%) depending on the split ratio of train-data and test-data. Xception network obtained the second best results (accuracy = 72 +/- 4% to accuracy = 65 +/- 4, specificity = 81 +/- 6% to specificity = 73 +/- 3%, sensitivity = 55 +/- 4% to sensitivity = 52 +/- 5%, and balanced_accuracy = 66 +/- 5% to balanced_accuracy = 60 +/- 4%). The worst results were obtained using VGG-16 transfer learning network. CONCLUSION: Deep learning networks in conjunction with CT imaging are able to predict the tumor response to NAC for patients with LABC prior to start. A ViT transformer could obtain the best performance, which demonstrated the importance of attention mechanism.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer with triple-negative subtype (TNBC) presents significant challenges with limited treatment options and a poorer prognosis than others. While PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise, their efficacy in TNBC remains constrained. In recent years, nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer a novel approach to enhance cancer therapy by optimizing the tumor microenvironment and augmenting chemo- and immunotherapy effects in various preclinical and clinical settings. This review discusses recent investigations in NP strategies for improving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-based combination therapy for TNBC. Those include single or multi-therapeutic NPs designed to enhance immunogenicity of the tumor, induce immunogenic cell death, and target immunosuppressive elements within the tumor microenvironment. The investigations also include NPs co-loaded with PD-L1 inhibitors and other therapeutic agents, leveraging targeted delivery and synergistic effects to maximize efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. Overall, NP approaches represent a promising avenue for enhancing PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade-based combination therapy in TNBC and encourage further developmental studies.",

ANG dysregulation is closely associated with the development of breast, nasopharyngeal, and lung cancers. In recent years, studies have found that ANG not only induces neovascularisation by activating endothelial cells, but also plays a regulatory role in the plasticity of cancer cells. Cellular plasticity plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation, progression, migration, therapeutic resistance, and relapse. Therefore, it is a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and therapy.

        "AB": "Background: In breast cancer oncogenesis, the precise role of cell apoptosis holds untapped potential for prognostic and therapeutic insights. Thus, it is important to develop a model predicated for breast cancer patients' prognosis and immunotherapy response based on apoptosis-related signature. Methods: Our approach involved leveraging a training dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to construct an apoptosis-related gene prognostic model. The model's validity was then tested across several cohorts, including METABRIC, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital Sun Yat-sen University (SYSMH), and IMvigor210, to ensure its applicability and robustness across different patient demographics and treatment scenarios. Furthermore, we utilized Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) analysis to explore the expression patterns of these model genes in breast cancer cell lines compared to immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines, aiming to confirm their differential expression and underline their significance in the context of breast cancer. Results: Through the development and validation of our prognostic model based on seven apoptosis-related genes, we have demonstrated its substantial predictive power for the survival outcomes of breast cancer patients. The model effectively stratified patients into high and low-risk categories, with high-risk patients showing significantly poorer overall survival in the training cohort and across all validation cohorts. Importantly, qPCR analysis confirmed that the genes constituting our model indeed exhibit differential expression in breast cancer cell lines when contrasted with immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines. Conclusion: Our study establishes a groundbreaking prognostic model using apoptosis-related genes to enhance the precision of breast cancer prognosis and treatment, particularly in predicting immunotherapy response.",

        "AB": "Secondary tumors of the ampulla of Vater are exceedingly rare and associated with relatively poor prognosis. Tumors of the ampulla are classified into four distinct subtypes based on the location and involvement of surrounding structures. Most reported cases are of renal cell or malignant skin melanoma primary with only five previously reported cases of breast primary found in a literature review. We present a 72-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer to the ampulla of Vater as well as multiple bones. She had a history of breast cancer status post bilateral mastectomy and chemo 27 years prior. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have an acute liver injury. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a distended gallbladder and an indeterminate left retroperitoneal mass concerning for cystic or necrotic lymphadenopathy. Endoscopy then showed an edematous and erythematous periampullary region, which was biopsied and returned positive for carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the retroperitoneal mass returned positive for keratin, estrogen receptor, GATA3, and MOC31 and negative for progesterone receptor, WT1, calretinin, and E-cadherin. The periampullary region's immunohistochemistry returned positive for pankeratin (AE1/AE3) and CD138 and negative for CD45 and S100, supporting a diagnosis of primary breast carcinoma. The average time from diagnosis of breast cancer to metastasis was found to be 2.5 years. Endoscopic visual presentation of metastatic cancer to the ampulla is indistinguishable from that of primary cancers. Thus, a biopsy with cytology and immunohistochemical analysis is necessary for diagnosis. Management of secondary ampullary tumors requires a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology, surgery, oncology, and often palliative care. Secondary tumors have been found to be treated by any combination of Whipple's resections, chemotherapy, drainage/stenting, and endoscopic ampullectomy.",

        "AB": "Background and objective Prolactin (PRL) has a high specificity toward breast cancer (BC), making it a valuable marker in both diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we aimed to compare serum PRL levels between pre- and post-menopausal women with BC, as well as normal reference values. We also investigated the association of various risk factors with PRL levels in women with BC. Methods The study involved adult women diagnosed with BC based on clinical features and tissue histopathology receiving treatment at a tertiary care center in Pune, India. General and demographic information, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and BMI), menstrual status (age at menarche and menopausal state), clinical presentation (signs and symptoms), duration of symptoms, and parity were recorded by using a pre-tested proforma based on hospital records or in-person interviews. Serum PRL was measured by the RIA method (sandwich assay). Results A total of 67 women (average age: 47.5 +/- 11.8 years; 33 of them post-menopausal) with BC were included in the study. The participants had an average BMI of 24.9 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2),( )and 26 (39%) of them were overweight. The majority of women had BC stage IIA disease, involvement of the right side or upper outer quadrant, and had attained menarche after 14 years of age; 47 women had a BC duration of >3 months. Seven women were nulliparous, and the remaining had given birth to their first child before the age of 26 years. The average serum PRL level among the participants was 9.27 +/- 7.62 ng/mL, with higher levels found in post-menopausal women compared to pre-menopausal women (11.08 vs. 7.51 ng/mL, respectively; p=0.08). Women with a higher stage and greater duration of disease had significantly higher serum PRL levels (p<0.001 for both). When compared with reference values, pre-menopausal women showed significantly lower (6.25 vs. 10.9, respectively; p=0.001) and post-menopausal women showed significantly higher (8.55 vs. 5.95; p=0.004) serum PRL levels. A positive correlation was found between serum PRL and age at the time of birth of the first child (p=0.068). Conclusions Based on our findings, PRL is an important hormone in the development of BC in women. Therapeutic modulation of PRL may be a realistic and novel approach to curing human BC, either administered alone or in combination with conventional treatments.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC), the metastatic spread of cancer to the leptomeninges, is a rare complication and has a dismal prognosis. Due to limited data available on LMC from India, we conducted a country-wise audit of LMC across 15 centres in India. METHODS: The current study conducted in 2020, was a retrospective, multicentric audit of adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with diagnosis of LMC and who received treatment during 2010-2020. Baseline characteristics, details related to previous treatments, cancer sites, LMC diagnosis, treatment pattern and overall survival (OS) were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed, and Kaplan Meier analysis was performed for the estimation of OS. FINDINGS: Among the patients diagnosed with LMC (n = 84), diagnosis was confirmed in 52 patients (61.9%) and 'probable' in 32 (38.1%) patients. The three most common cause of malignancy were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer with 45 (53.6%), 22 (26.1%) and 9 (10.7%) patients respectively. Intrathecal therapy was offered in 33 patients (39.3%). The most common intrathecal agent was methotrexate in 23 patients (27.4%). The median OS was 90 days (95% CI 48-128). Among tested variables, intrathecal therapy administration (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.68) and primary in lung (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.83) had a favourable impact on OS. INTERPRETATION: Prognosis with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is poor with a significant burden of morbidity and mortality in India. This data aims to highlight the current outcomes and facilitate further research on LMC. FUNDING: None.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Available data on cost of cancer treatment, out-of-pocket payment and reimbursement are limited in India. We estimated the treatment costs, out-of-pocket payment, and reimbursement in a cohort of breast cancer patients who sought treatment at a publicly funded tertiary cancer care hospital in India. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted from June 2019 to March 2022 at Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), Mumbai. Data on expenditure during each visit of treatment was collected by a team of trained medical social workers. The primary outcome variables were total cost (TC) of treatment, out-of-pocket payment (OOP), and reimbursement. TC included cost incurred by breast cancer patients during treatment at TMC. OOP was defined as the total cost incurred at TMC less of reimbursement. Reimbursement was any form of financial assistance (cashless or repayment), including social health insurance, private health insurance, employee health schemes, and assistance from charitable trusts, received by the patients for breast cancer treatment. FINDINGS: Of the 500 patients included in the study, 45 discontinued treatment (due to financial or other reasons) and 26 died during treatment. The mean TC of breast cancer treatment was \u20b9258,095/US$3531 (95% CI: 238,225, 277,934). Direct medical cost (MC) accounted for 56.3% of the TC. Systemic therapy costs (\u20b950,869/US$696) were higher than radiotherapy (\u20b933,483/US$458) and surgery costs (\u20b925,075/US$343). About 74.4% patients availed some form of financial assistance at TMC; 8% patients received full reimbursement. The mean OOP for breast cancer treatment was \u20b9186,461/US$2551 (95% CI: 167,666, 205,257), accounting for 72.2% of the TC. Social health insurance (SHI) had a reasonable coverage (33.1%), followed by charitable trusts (29.6%), employee health insurance (5.1%), private health insurance (4.4%) and 25.6% had no reimbursement. But SHI covered only 40.1% of the TC of treatment compared to private health insurance that covered as much as 57.1% of it. Both TC and OOP were higher for patients who were younger, belonged to rural areas, had a comorbidity, were diagnosed at an advanced stage, and were from outside Maharashtra. INTERPRETATION: In India, the cost and OOP for breast cancer treatment are high and reimbursement for the treatment flows from multiple sources. Though many of the patients receive some form of reimbursement, it is insufficient to prevent high OOP. Hence both wider insurance coverage as well as higher cap of the insurance packages in the health insurance schemes is suggested. Allowing for the automatic inclusion of cancer treatment in SHI can mitigate the financial burden of cancer patients in India.

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in India. Clinical trials are critical for driving innovation in cancer therapy, diagnosis, and prevention. This study aims to depict the evolving landscape of cancer clinical trials in India by analysing the clinical trials registered in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI). METHODS: We identified cancer trials registered in CTRI (between 2007 and 2021) using search terms adapted from the cancer types defined by the National Cancer Institute (USA). We then collated and analysed the publicly available information from CTRI (cancer subtypes, type of trial, treatment intent, type of intervention, sponsor type, recruitment countries) and used descriptive statistics to illustrate the overall as well as year-to-year trend. FINDINGS: In total, we identified 1988 cancer trials, the majority of which focused on treating cancer (63%) and rest of the trials aimed at optimising the operational aspects of surgery (19%), mitigating treatment-related toxicity (10.6%), or treating cancer-related symptoms (7.8%). Focusing on trials with the intent of treating cancer, we found that most were investigating solid tumours as opposed to haematological malignancies with the most prominent cancer subtypes being breast cancer (17%), head and neck cancer (9.8%), lung cancer (9.6%), and cervical cancer (6.6%). The number of trials conducted in a given cancer subtype from our analysis overall correlated to the incidence, mortality, and 5-year prevalence of the respective cancer subtype in India; however, head and neck cancer and cervical cancer were underrepresented in trials as compared with the disease burden. The most common type of intervention was investigational drugs. The most common sponsor types were global pharmaceutical industry (26%) and research institution and hospital (26%). Despite a relatively high cancer burden, the availability of cancer trials in the Northeastern states of India was limited. INTERPRETATION: There is a pressing need for clinical cancer research in India to be better aligned with the nation's healthcare needs and disease burden, focusing on prevalent and deadly cancers while ensuring the availability of clinical trials across geographic regions and underserved populations.

        "AB": "PURPOSE: This investigation leveraged the SEER database to delve into the progression patterns of PTC when left untreated. Furthermore, it aimed to devise and authenticate a nomogram for prognosis prediction for such patients. METHODS: We extracted data from the SEER database, focusing on PTC-diagnosed individuals from 2004-2020. To discern disease progression intervals, median survival times across stages were gauged, and the disease progression time was estimated by subtracting the median survival time of a more severe stage from its preceding stage. Prognostic determinants in the training set were pinpointed using both univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Using these determinants, a prognostic nomogram was crafted. RESULTS: In untreated PTC patients, those in stages I and II had a favorable prognosis, with 10-year overall survival rates of 86.34% and 66.03%, respectively. Patients in stages III and IV had a relatively poorer prognosis. The median survival time of stage III, stage IVA, stage IVB and stage IVC patients was 108months, 43 months, 20 months and 8 months, respectively. The deduced progression intervals from stages III-IVC were 65, 23, and 12 months. In the training set, age, tumor stage, gender, and marital status were identified as independent risk factors influencing the prognosis of untreated PTC, and a nomogram was constructed using these variables. CONCLUSION: In the absence of treatment intervention, early-stage PTC progressed slowly with an overall favorable prognosis. However, in mid to advanced-stage PTC, as tumor stage increased, disease progression accelerated, and prognosis gradually worsened. Age, tumor stage, marital status, and gender were independent risk factors influencing the prognosis of untreated PTC, and the nomogram based on these factors demonstrated good prognostic capability.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This article reviews clinical trial data that assesses the safety, efficacy, and clinical application of spesolimab, an interleukin-36 (IL-36) blocker, for the treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature was conducted using the search terms: \"spesolimab,\" \"BI 655130,\" and \"spevigo\" in MEDLINE (PubMed) and Clinicaltrials.gov from January 1, 1950 to October 31, 2023. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant articles in English relating to the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of spesolimab were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: In one phase 2 clinical trial evaluating single dose IV spesolimab for GPP flares at day 8, 54% of patients receiving spesolimab had a GPP physician global assessment (GPPGA) pustulation subscore of 0, and 43% had a GPPGA total score of 0 compared with 6% and 11% for the placebo group, respectively. Another phase 2 clinical trial assessing subcutaneous spesolimab found 23% of patients in low-dose, 29% in medium-dose, and 10% of high-dose spesolimab had flares by week 48 compared with 52% of the placebo group. Hazard ratios for time to GPP flare compared with placebo were 0.16 (P = 0.0005), 0.35 (P = 0.0057), and 0.47 (P = 0.027) for the spesolimab groups, respectively. Infection rates were similar across treatment and placebo groups, and severe adverse events such as drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptom (DRESS), cholelithiasis, and breast cancer occurred with spesolimab. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING DRUGS: Spesolimab is a first-in-class IL-36 monoclonal antibody receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of acute GPP flares. It is a safe and effective therapeutic agent in preventing future GPP flares, with no current comparator trials with other GPP agents. CONCLUSION: Spesolimab is a safe and effective treatment for acute GPP flares in adults. Future clinical trials can establish safety and efficacy compared with other agents.",

        "AB": "Cancer comes in second place on the list of causes of death worldwide. In 2018, the 5-year prevalence of breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) were 30%, 12.3%, and 10.9%, respectively. Cannabinoids are chemicals derived from the Cannabis sativa plant; the most investigated cannabinoids are cannabinol, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), and cannabidiol. In humans, the endogenous endocannabinoid system consists of endocannabinoids, cannabinoids receptors (CBs), and enzymes that degrade the endocannabinoids. In this review, we will review the most recent literature for evidence that discusses the role of cannabis in the treatment of the three types of neoplasms mentioned. Studies have proved that BC cells express CB receptors; many in-vivo studies showed that cannabinoids cause apoptosis and inhibit proliferation and migration. Also, researchers found that treating BC mice with THC and JWH-133 (CB2 receptor agonist) slowed the tumor growth. Regarding CRC, cannabidiol was found to decrease the viability of chemotherapy-resistant CRC cells and inhibit metastasis by antagonizing the G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55; a novel cannabinoid receptor) necessary for metastasis. Moreover, cannabidiol had anti-angiogenetic effects by reducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in addition to anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, studies demonstrated that PC cells highly express CB1 and CB2 receptors and that cannabinoids are capable of inhibiting the release of exosomes and microvesicles related to cancer progression. Cannabinoids also have antiproliferative, anti-invasive, anti-fibroblastic, cell cycle arrest, and proapoptotic effects on PC cells.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are the most studied anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins. We previously characterized both of them, not only for their role in regulating apoptosis and resistance to therapy in cancer cells, but also for their non-canonical functions, mainly including promotion of cancer progression, metastatization, angiogenesis, and involvement in the crosstalk among cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. Our goal was to identify transcriptional signature and novel cellular pathways specifically modulated by Bcl-2. METHODS: We performed RNAseq analysis of siRNA-mediated transient knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in human melanoma cells and gene ontology analysis to identify a specific Bcl-2 transcriptional signature. Expression of genes modulated by Bcl-2 and associated to Hippo pathway were validated in human melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. Western blotting analysis were performed to analyse protein expression of upstream regulators of YAP and in relation to different level of Bcl-2 protein. The effects of YAP silencing in Bcl-2 overexpressing cancer cells were evaluated in migration and cell viability assays in relation to different stiffness conditions. In vitro wound healing assays and co-cultures were used to evaluate cancer-specific Bcl-2 ability to activate fibroblasts. RESULTS: We demonstrated the Bcl-2-dependent modulation of Hippo Pathway in cancer cell lines from different tumor types by acting on upstream YAP regulators. YAP inhibition abolished the ability of Bcl-2 to increase tumor cell migration and proliferation on high stiffness condition of culture, to stimulate in vitro fibroblasts migration and to induce fibroblasts activation. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that Bcl-2 regulates the Hippo pathway in different tumor types, promoting cell migration, adaptation to higher stiffness culture condition and fibroblast activation. Our data indicate that Bcl-2 inhibitors should be further investigated to counteract cancer-promoting mechanisms.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain poor. Although the concomitant use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and anti-chemotherapeutic agents has been investigated to improve the antileukemic effect on AML, its usefulness remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of G-CSF priming as a remission induction therapy or salvage chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed a thorough literature search for studies related to the priming effect of G-CSF using PubMed, Ichushi-Web, and the Cochrane Library. A qualitative analysis of the pooled data was performed, and risk ratios (RRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and summarized. RESULTS: Two reviewers independently extracted and accessed the 278 records identified during the initial screening, and 62 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility in second screening. Eleven studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 10 in the meta-analysis. A systematic review revealed that priming with G-CSF did not correlate with an improvement in response rate and overall survival (OS). The result of the meta-analysis revealed the tendency for lower relapse rate in the G-CSF priming groups without inter-study heterogeneity [RR, 0.91 (95% CI 0.82-1.01), p = 0.08; I(2) = 4%, p = 0.35]. In specific populations, including patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk and those receiving high-dose cytarabine, the G-CSF priming regimen prolonged OS. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF priming in combination with intensive remission induction treatment is not universally effective in patients with AML. Further studies are required to identify the patient cohort for which G-CSF priming is recommended.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer patients often have a poor prognosis largely due to lack of effective targeted therapy. It is now well established that monosaccharide enhances growth retardation and chemotherapy sensitivity in tumor cells. We investigated whether D-arabinose has capability to restrict the proliferation of tumor cells and its mechanism. Here, we report that D-arabinose induced cytotoxicity is modulated by autophagy and p38 MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cell lines. The proliferation of cells was evaluated by CCK-8 and Colony formation assay. The distribution of cells in cell cycle phases was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle, autophagy and MAPK signaling related proteins were detected by western blotting. Mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the efficacy of D-arabinose in vivo. The proliferation of cells was dramatically inhibited by D-arabinose exposure in a dose-dependent manner, which was relevant to cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by G2/M cell cycle restriction and ectopic expression of cell cycle related proteins. Mechanistically, we further identified that D-arabinose is positively associated with autophagy and the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling in breast cancer. In contrast, 3-Ma or SB203580, the inhibitor of autophagy or p38 MAPK, reversed the efficacy of D-arabinose. Additionally, D-arabinose in vivo treatment could significantly inhibit xenograft growth of breast cancer cells. Our findings were the first to reveal that D-arabinose triggered cell cycle arrest by inducing autophagy through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.",

        "AB": "The liver is a major metastatic site (organ) for gastrointestinal cancers (such as colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers) as well as non-gastrointestinal cancers (such as lung, breast, and melanoma cancers). Due to the innate anatomical position of the liver, the apoptosis of T cells in the liver, the unique metabolic regulation of hepatocytes and other potential mechanisms, the liver tends to form an immunosuppressive microenvironment and subsequently form a pre-metastatic niche (PMN), which can promote metastasis and colonization by various tumor cells(TCs). As a result, the critical role of immunoresponse in liver based metastasis has become increasingly appreciated. T cells, a centrally important member of adaptive immune response, play a significant role in liver based metastases and clarifying the different roles of the various T cells subsets is important to guide future clinical treatment. In this review, we first introduce the predisposing factors and related mechanisms of liver metastasis (LM) before introducing the PMN and its transition to LM. Finally, we detail the role of different subsets of T cells in LM and advances in the management of LM in order to identify potential therapeutic targets for patients with LM.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors improve the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive unresectable locally advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (aTNBC), but randomised data in rapidly relapsing aTNBC are scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IMpassion132 (NCT03371017) enrolled patients with aTNBC relapsing <12 months after last chemotherapy dose (anthracycline and taxane required) or surgery for early TNBC. PD-L1 status was centrally assessed using SP142 before randomisation. Initially patients were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status. From August 2019, enrolment was restricted to PD-L1-positive (tumour immune cell >/=1%) aTNBC. Patients were randomised 1:1 to placebo or atezolizumab 1200 mg every 21 days with investigator-selected chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin plus gemcitabine or capecitabine monotherapy), visceral (lung and/or liver) metastases and (initially) PD-L1 status. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), tested hierarchically in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours and then, if positive, in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (all-comer patients randomised pre-August 2019). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. RESULTS: Among 354 patients with rapidly relapsing PD-L1-positive aTNBC, 68% had a disease-free interval of <6 months and 73% received carboplatin/gemcitabine. The OS hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.73-1.20, P = 0.59; median 11.2 months with placebo versus 12.1 months with atezolizumab). mITT and subgroup results were consistent. Median PFS was 4 months across treatment arms and populations. ORRs were 28% with placebo versus 40% with atezolizumab. Adverse events (predominantly haematological) were similar between arms and as expected with atezolizumab plus carboplatin/gemcitabine or capecitabine following recent chemotherapy exposure. CONCLUSIONS: OS, which is dismal in patients with TNBC relapsing within <12 months, was not improved by adding atezolizumab to chemotherapy. A biology-based definition of intrinsic resistance to immunotherapy in aTNBC is urgently needed to develop novel therapies for these patients in next-generation clinical trials.",

        "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Upper limb (UL) dysfunctions are highly prevalent in people after breast cancer and have a great impact on performing activities in daily living. To improve care, a more comprehensive understanding of the development and persistence of UL dysfunctions is needed. Therefore, the UPLIFT-BC study will primarily examine the prognostic value of different factors at the body functions and structures, environmental and personal level of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework at 1-month post-surgery for persisting UL dysfunctions at 6 months after finishing cancer treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study, running from 1-week pre-surgery to 6 months post-local cancer treatment, is performed in a cohort of 250 women diagnosed with primary breast cancer. Different potentially prognostic factors to UL dysfunctions, covering body functions and structures, environmental and personal factors of the ICF, are assessed pre-surgically and at different time points post-surgery. The primary aim is to investigate the prognostic value of these factors at 1-month post-surgery for subjective UL function (ie, QuickDASH) at 6 months post-cancer treatment, that is, 6 months post-radiotherapy or post-surgery (T3), depending on the individuals' cancer treatment trajectory. In this, factors with relevant prognostic value pre-surgery are considered as well. Similar analyses are performed with an objective measure for UL function (ie, accelerometry) and a composite score of the combination of subjective and objective UL function. Second, in the subgroup of participants who receive radiotherapy, the prognostic value of the same factors is explored at 1-month post-radiotherapy and 6 months post-surgery. A forward stepwise selection strategy is used to obtain these multivariable prognostic models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of UZ/KU Leuven (reference number s66248). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at several research conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05297591.",

        "AB": "Current clinical therapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have limited therapeutic efficacy and induce significant systemic side effects, leading to poor patient compliance. To address this challenge, this investigation focuses on the design of LINC02535 + miR-30a-5p for treating breast cancer. In vitro cytotoxicity studies confirmed that LINC02535 + miR-30a-5p was more effective in 4 T1 cells, with reduced toxicity in NIH3T3 cells. Further verification of cellular morphology was achieved through various biochemical staining methods. Additionally, the antimetastatic attributes of LINC02535 + miR-30a-5p have been evaluated using both migration scratch and Transwell migration assays, which have collectively revealed excellent antimetastatic potential. The DNA fragmentation of the 4 T1 cells was assessed using a comet assay. LINC02535 + miR-30a-5p improved ROS levels and caused mitochondrial membrane potential alterations and DNA damage, which resulted in apoptosis. Therefore, we propose that LINC02535 + miR-30a-5p could be an alternative therapeutic strategy for breast cancer therapy.",

        "AB": "Progressive incidence and a pessimistic survival rate of breast cancer in women worldwide remains one of the most concerning topics. Progressing research indicates a potentially high effectiveness of use cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) systems. The undoubted advantage seems its simplicity in combination with other anti-cancer modalities. Following observed trend of studies, one inventory CAP system was applied to directly treat human breast cancer cell lines and culturing in two different Plasma Activated Media (PAM) for combined utilization. Proposed CAP treatments on MCF-10\u202fA, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were studied in terms of impact on cell viability by MTT assay. Disturbances in cell motility following direct and combined CAP application were assessed by scratch test. Finally, the induction of apoptosis and necrosis was verified with annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Reactive species generated during CAP treatment were determined based on optical emission spectrometry analysis along with colorimetric methods to qualitatively assess the NO(2)(-), NO(3)(-), H(2)O(2), and total ROS with free radicals concentration. The most effective approach for CAP utilization was combined treatment, leading to significant disruption in cell viability, motility and mostly apoptosis induction in breast cancer cell lines. Determined CAP dose allows for mild outcome, showing insignificant harm for the non-cancerous MCF-10\u202fA cell line, while the highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line shows the highest sensitivity on proposed CAP treatment. Direct CAP treatment seems to drive the cells into the sensitive state in which the effectiveness of PAM is boosted. Observed anti-cancer response of CAP treatment was mostly triggered by RNS (mostly NO(2)(-) ions) and ROS along with free radicals (such as H(2)O(2), OH(*), O(2)(-*), (1)O(2), HO(2)(*)). The combined application of one CAP source represent a promising alternative in the development of new and effective modalities for breast cancer treatment.",

        "AB": "Sex steroid hormones such as estrogen estradiol (E2) and androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are involved in the development of hormone-dependent cancers. Blockade of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (17beta-HSD7), a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, is thought to decrease E2 levels while increasing those of DHT. Therefore, its unique double action makes this enzyme as an interesting drug target for treatment of breast cancer. The chemical synthesis, molecular characterization, and preliminary biological evaluation as 17beta-HSD7 inhibitors of novel carbamate derivatives 3 and 4 are described. Like previous 17beta-HSD7 inhibitors 1 and 2, compounds 3 and 4 bear a hydrophobic nonyl side chain at the C-17beta position of a 4-aza-5alpha-androstane nucleus, but compound 3 has an oxygen atom replacing the CH(2) in the steroid A-ring C-2 position, while compound 4 has a C17-spiranic E-ring containing a carbamate function. They both inhibited the in vitro transformation of estrone (E1) into E2 by 17beta-HSD7, but the introduction of a (17R)-spirocarbamate is preferable to replacing C-2 methylene with an oxygen atom since compound 4 (IC(50) = 63nM) is an inhibitor 14 times more powerful than compound 3 (IC(50) = 900nM). Furthermore, when compared to the reference inhibitor 1 (IC(50) = 111nM), the use of a C17-spiranic E-ring made it possible to introduce differently the hydrophobic nonyl side chain, without reducing the inhibitory activity.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly challenging subtype of breast cancer, with a poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Unfortunately, unlike luminal type cancers, there is no validated biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with early-stage TNBC. Accurate biomarkers are needed to establish effective therapeutic strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of tumor samples from 184 TNBC patients (training cohort, n=76; validation cohort, n=108) using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: By combining weighted gene expression, we identified a 10-gene signature (DGKH, GADD45B, KLF7, LYST, NR6A1, PYCARD, ROBO1, SLC22A20P, SLC24A3, and SLC45A4) that stratified patients by risk score with high sensitivity (92.31%), specificity (92.06%), and accuracy (92.11%) for invasive disease-free survival. The 10-gene signature was validated in a separate institution cohort and supported by meta-analysis for biological relevance to well-known driving pathways in TNBC. Furthermore, the 10-gene signature was the only independent factor for invasive disease-free survival in multivariate analysis when compared to other potential biomarkers of TNBC molecular subtypes and T-cell receptor beta diversity. 10-gene signature also further categorized patients classified as molecular subtypes according to risk scores. CONCLUSION: Our novel findings may help address the prognostic challenges in TNBC and the 10-gene signature could serve as a novel biomarker for risk-based patient care.",

        "AB": "Four Ru(II) complexes (A2-A5) were synthesized from the reaction of coumarin Schiff base ligands (7da2-tsc, 7da3-mtsc, 7da4-etsc and 7da5-ptsc) with [RuHCl(CO)(PPh(3))(3)]. The compounds were characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis, (1)H, (13)C and (31)P NMR, mass spectrometry and crystallographic analysis. Calf Thymus DNA (CT-DNA) binding studies revealed the intercalative mode of binding of the complexes with DNA. The results of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) binding studies established the interaction between BSA followed static quenching mechanism. The cytotoxic effects of the complexes and the ligands were evaluated against breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and lung carcinoma cell lines (A549 and NCI-H460) using MTT assay. Complex A4 demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects on both breast and lung cancer cells. Furthermore, morphological observations and FACS analysis showed the decrease in cell density by complex A4 by induced morphological changes and apoptotic body formation and cell death in both breast and lung cancer cells. Moreover, the invertebrate model Caenorhabditis elegans was employed to assess the in vivo anticancer activity of compound A4. The findings indicated that the treatment with A4 reduced tumor development and significantly extended organismal lifespan by 64 % in the tumoral strain JK1466 without adversely affecting essential physiological functions of the worm. Additionally, A4 demonstrated an upregulation of two crucial antioxidant defense genes. Overall, these results suggested that the compound A4 can be a potential candidate with novel chemotherapeutic applications.",

        "AB": "Visceral Crisis (VC) in breast cancer is a critical scenario when the burden of metastatic disease results in rapid deterioration of organ functions. There are no widely accepted objective clinical criteria for the definition of VC, and different studies have reported diverse clinical conditions such as visceral crises. Diagnosis of VC is associated with a dismal prognosis and the management of this condition is currently based on limited retrospective evidence and expert opinions. International guidelines have recommended cytotoxic polychemotherapy in the management of VC, to achieve rapid symptomatic control and preserve organ function. Nevertheless, in the case of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the role of chemotherapy as the treatment of choice for VC has been recently questioned, since endocrine therapy plus CDK4/6 inhibitors yielded similar response rates, with better quality of life. For HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, combined chemotherapy (plus HER2-directed therapy for HER2-positive) remains a standard option for VC, but novel effective drugs such as antibody-drug conjugates are emerging and their role in the VC context shall soon be elucidated. This review aims to critically discuss the definition, prognosis, management, and future directions regarding the visceral crisis in metastatic breast cancer.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: Local ablative therapy, such as radiotherapy or surgery, plays a key role in treatment of patients with oligometastatic disease. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) comes to the fore as a safe and effective treatment for patients with a limited number of metastases, even those located in hard-to-reach body sites. Many researchers have suggested that metastatsis-directed therapy could improve long-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with oligometastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-arm, observational study conducted between July 2015 and February 2022. In our institute, 60 patients with controlled primary tumors and one to five metastases were treated with SABR. Prescribed radiation doses ranged from 12 to 60 Gy administered in one to seven fractions. We aimed to determine whether metastatic-directed therapy using SABR for all oligometastases affects OS and PFS and whether the primary tumor or metastatic site influences OS/PFS. RESULTS: The most common primary malignancy types were prostate (n = 14), colorectal (n = 10), lung (n = 7), and breast cancers (n = 6). The median follow-up was 30 months, ranging from 9 to 79. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS and OS rates were 54.9%, 37.0%, and 37.0% and 98.3%, 84.4%, and 73.8%, respectively, and the median time to first progression was 15 (range, 2-32) months. Twenty-four (40%) patients had no recurrence. In our analysis, primary tumor site was not an independent prognostic factor. The metastatic site may influence on patient outcome in cases of localized bone and liver metastases. CONCLUSION: In our retrospective analysis, SABR was associated with favorable levels of PFS and OS in patients with oligometastases. The limitations of our study were lacking high-level evidence, and randomized studies to compare SABR and palliative standard of care are mandatory.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To update the ASCO guideline on the management of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adult survivors of cancer. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, geriatric oncology, internal medicine, psychology, psychiatry, exercise oncology, integrative medicine, behavioral oncology, nursing, and advocacy experts was convened. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2013-2023. RESULTS: The evidence base consisted of 113 RCTs. Exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and mindfulness-based programs led to improvements in CRF both during and after the completion of cancer treatment. Tai chi, qigong, and American ginseng showed benefits during treatment, whereas yoga, acupressure, and moxibustion helped to manage CRF after completion of treatment. Use of other dietary supplements did not improve CRF during or after cancer treatment. In patients at the end of life, CBT and corticosteroids showed benefits. Certainty and quality of evidence were low to moderate for CRF management interventions. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, mindfulness-based programs, and tai chi or qigong to reduce the severity of fatigue during cancer treatment. Psychoeducation and American ginseng may be recommended in adults undergoing cancer treatment. For survivors after completion of treatment, clinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, and mindfulness-based programs; in particular, CBT and mindfulness-based programs have shown efficacy for managing moderate to severe fatigue after treatment. Yoga, acupressure, and moxibustion may also be recommended. Patients at the end of life may be offered CBT and corticosteroids. Clinicians should not recommend L-carnitine, antidepressants, wakefulness agents, or routinely recommend psychostimulants to manage symptoms of CRF. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against other psychosocial, integrative, or pharmacological interventions for the management of fatigue.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Compromised autophagy, including impaired mitophagy and lysosomal function, plays pivotal roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Urolithin A (UA) is a gut microbial metabolite of ellagic acid that stimulates mitophagy. The effects of UA's long-term treatment of AD and mechanisms of action are unknown. METHODS: We addressed these questions in three mouse models of AD with behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches. RESULTS: Long-term UA treatment significantly improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in different AD transgenic mice. UA also reduced amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau pathologies and enhanced long-term potentiation. UA induced mitophagy via increasing lysosomal functions. UA improved cellular lysosomal function and normalized lysosomal cathepsins, primarily cathepsin Z, to restore lysosomal function in AD, indicating the critical role of cathepsins in UA-induced therapeutic effects on AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of lysosomal dysfunction in AD etiology and points to the high translational potential of UA. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term urolithin A (UA) treatment improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. UA restored lysosomal functions in part by regulating cathepsin Z (Ctsz) protein. UA modulates immune responses and AD-specific pathophysiological pathways.",

        "AB": "Bone metastases occur frequently in common malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer. They are responsible for considerable morbidity and skeletal-related events. Fortunately, there are now several systemic, focal, and targeted therapies that can improve quality and length of life, including radionuclide therapies. It is therefore important that bone metastases can be detected as early as possible and that treatment can be accurately and sensitively monitored. Several bone-specific and tumor-specific single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography molecular imaging agents are available, for detection and monitoring response to systemic therapeutics, as well as theranostic agents to confirm target expression and predict response to radionuclide therapies.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible therapeutic effect of HCS against breast cancer (BRCA) using cytology, network pharmacology, and molecular biology approaches. The half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of HCS in the BRCA cells was determined by cytotoxicity assay, and were accordingly treated with high and low doses HCS in the TUNEL and scratch assays. The potential targets of HCS in the BRCA cells were identified through functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and verified by molecular docking. The expression levels of key signaling pathways-related proteins in HCS-treated BRCA cells by western blotting. HCS inhibited the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we screened 289 core HCS targets against BRCA, which were primarily enriched in the PI3K-AKT, MAPK chemokines, and other. signaling pathways. In addition, PIK3CA, PIK3CD, and MTOR were confirmed as HCS targets by molecular docking. Consistent with this, we observed a reduction in the expression levels of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and MTOR in the HCS-treated BRCA cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that HCS inhibits the growth of BRCA cells by targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway, and warrants further investigation as a therapeutic agent for treating patients with BRCA.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study aims to analyse the relationship between sedentary behaviour and breast cancer (BC) risk from a social perspective. METHODS: Women aged 45-70 who participated in the Valencia Region Breast Cancer Screening Programme (2018-2019) were included, with a total of 121,359 women analysed, including 506 with cancer and 120,853 without cancer. The response variable was BC (screen-detected) and the main explanatory variable was sedentary behaviour (</=2 / >2-</=3 / >3-</=5 / >5 hours/day, h/d). Nested logistic regression models (M) were estimated: M1: sedentary behaviour adjusted for age and family history of BC; M2: M1 + hormonal/reproductive variables (menopausal status, number of pregnancies, hormone replacement therapy; in addition, months of breastfeeding was added for a subsample of women with one or more live births); M3: M2 + lifestyle variables (body mass index, smoking habits); M4: M3 + socioeconomic variables (educational level, occupation); Final model: M4 + gender variables (childcare responsibilities, family size). Interaction between sedentary behaviour and educational level was analysed in the Final model. Moreover, for the whole sample, postmenopausal women and HR+ BC, the Final model was stratified by educational level. RESULTS: Sedentary behaviour was associated with an increased risk of BC with a nearly statistically significant effect in the Final model (>2-</=3 h/d: OR = 1.22 (0.93-1.61); >3-</=5 h/d: OR = 1.14 (0.86-1.52); >5: OR = 1.19 (0.89-1.60)). For women with a low educational level, sitting more than 2 h/d was associated with an increased risk of BC in the whole sample (>2-</=3 h/d OR = 1.93 (1.19-3.21); in postmenopausal women (>2-</=3 h/d, OR = 2.12 (1.18-2.96), >5h/d OR = 1.75 (1.01-3.11)) and in HR+ BC (>2-</=3h/d, OR = 2.15 (1.22-3.99)). Similar results were observed for women with one or more live births. Conclusions Sitting >2 h/d is associated with BC risk in women with low educational level, especially in postmenopausal women and those with live births.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: While the scientific community widely recognizes the benefits of physical activity (PA) in oncology supportive care, cancer survivors who have undergone chemo- or radio-immunotherapy treatments struggle to meet PA recommendations. This underscores the importance of identifying factors influencing active lifestyle adoption and maintenance and proposing a multilevel model (micro-, meso-, and macrolevel) to better understand facilitators and barriers. Currently, no socioecological model explains an active lifestyle in the posttreatment phase of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to identify factors influencing an active lifestyle in cancer survivorship and assess the feasibility of an individualized program targeting an active lifestyle. The objectives will be addressed in 3 stages. Stage 1 aims to elucidate factors associated with the active lifestyle of cancer survivors. Stage 2 involves developing an explanatory model based on previously identified factors to create a tailored health education program for an active lifestyle after oncology treatments. Stage 3 aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential effects of this personalized health education program after its national implementation. METHODS: First, the exploration of factors influencing PA (stage 1) will be based on a mixed methods approach, using an explanatory sequential design and multilevel analysis. The quantitative phase involves completing a questionnaire from a socioecological perspective. Subsequently, a subset of respondents will engage in semistructured interviews to aid in interpreting the quantitative results. This phase aims to construct a model of the factors influencing an active lifestyle and develop an individualized 12-week program based on our earlier findings (stage 2). In stage 3, we will implement our multicenter, multimodal program for 150 physically inactive and sedentary cancer survivors across metropolitan France. Program feasibility will be evaluated. Measured PA level by connected device and multidimensional variables such as declared PA and sedentary behaviors, PA readiness, motivation, PA preferences, PA knowledge and skills, and barriers and facilitators will be assessed before and during the program and 52 weeks afterward. RESULTS: The institutional review board approved the mixed methods study (phase 1) in April 2020, and the intervention (phase 3) was approved in March 2022. Recruitment and data collection commenced in April 2022, with intervention implementation concluded in May 2023. Data collection and full analysis are expected to be finalized by July 2024. CONCLUSIONS: The Determinants and Factors of Physical Activity After Oncology Treatments (DEFACTO) study seeks to enhance our understanding, within our socioecological model, of factors influencing an active lifestyle among cancer survivors and to assess whether a tailored intervention based on this model can support an active lifestyle.

        "AB": "IMPORTANCE: Two prominent organizations, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Quality Forum (NQF), have developed a cancer quality metric aimed at reducing systemic anticancer therapy administration at the end of life. This metric, NQF 0210 (patients receiving chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life), has been critiqued for focusing only on care for decedents and not including the broader population of patients who may benefit from treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the overall population of patients with metastatic cancer receiving care at practices with higher rates of oncologic therapy for very advanced disease experience longer survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide population-based cohort study used Flatiron Health, a deidentified electronic health record database of patients diagnosed with metastatic or advanced disease, to identify adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with 1 of 6 common cancers (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial cancer) treated at health care practices from 2015 to 2019. Practices were stratified into quintiles based on retrospectively measured rates of NQF 0210, and overall survival was compared by disease type among all patients treated in each practice quintile from time of metastatic diagnosis using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to July 2023. EXPOSURE: Practice-level NQF 0210 quintiles. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Overall survival. RESULTS: Of 78\u202f446 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.3 [11.1] years; 52.2% female) across 144 practices, the most common cancer types were NSCLC (34\u202f201 patients [43.6%]) and colorectal cancer (15\u202f804 patients [20.1%]). Practice-level NQF 0210 rates varied from 10.9% (quintile 1) to 32.3% (quintile 5) for NSCLC and 6.8% (quintile 1) to 28.4% (quintile 5) for colorectal cancer. No statistically significant differences in survival were observed between patients treated at the highest and the lowest NQF 0210 quintiles. Compared with patients seen at practices in the lowest NQF 0210 quintiles, the hazard ratio for death among patients seen at the highest quintiles varied from 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55-0.99) for those with renal cell carcinoma to 1.41 (95% CI, 0.98-2.02) for those with urothelial cancer. These differences were not statistically significant after applying the Bonferroni-adjusted critical P = .008. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients with metastatic or advanced cancer treated at practices with higher NQF 0210 rates did not have improved survival. Future efforts should focus on helping oncologists identify when additional therapy is futile, developing goals of care communication skills, and aligning payment incentives with improved end-of-life care.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The study aimed to assess the effects of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) versus mastectomy on survival and quality of life in stages I, II and III breast cancer, providing solid evidence for clinical decisions. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on breast cancer treatments, searching databases such as PubMed and the Cochrane Library to compare BCS and mastectomy's effects on survival and quality of life. A combined total of 16,734 patients in the control group and 17,435 patients in the experimental group were included in this analysis. This meta-analysis used RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) software for analysis. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of 34,169 patients from 11 studies showed that BCS significantly reduced the overall recurrence rate at a median follow-up of 29 months, with a mean difference of 1.27 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.19-1.36, strongly supporting its effectiveness (p<0.00001). Furthermore, our analysis found no significant increase in 5-year local recurrence rates for BCS versus mastectomy, indicating its long-term effectiveness with a mean difference of 1.13 (95% CI: [1.03, 1.24], p = 0.01). Additionally, there was a notable decrease in tissue ischemic necrosis among patients who had received BCS, with a mean difference of 0.37 (95% CI: [0.33, 0.42], p<0.00001), underscoring its benefits and long-term viability. CONCLUSION: Breast-conserving surgery resulted in fewer cases of tissue ischemic necrosis and higher body image scores compared with mastectomy, suggesting it is a preferable option for better cosmetic outcomes and potentially favourable effects on prognosis and quality of life.",

If other mechanisms underlie the evolution of HDBC under adjuvant therapy is currently unknown. In this work, we employ functional genomics to dissect the contribution of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to cancer evolution by focusing on 12 megabases of non-coding DNA, including clonal enhancers, gene promoters, and boundaries of topologically associating domains. Parallel epigenetic perturbation (CRISPRi) in vitro reveals context-dependent roles for many of these CREs, with a specific impact on dormancy entrance and endocrine therapy resistance. Profiling of CRE somatic alterations in a unique, longitudinal cohort of patients treated with endocrine therapies identifies a limited set of non-coding changes potentially involved in therapy resistance. Overall, our data uncover how endocrine therapies triggers the emergence of transient features which could ultimately be exploited to hinder the adaptive process.",

Currently, no medicines target multiple systems to prevent metastatic progression through CD82 upregulation. This study screened for plant extracts displaying effects on cell proliferation, invasion, and CD82 expression in breast cancer cells, and in vivo angiogenesis, and further correlated between the biological activities and effect on CD82 expression. METHODS: Seventeen ethanolic plant extracts were screened for their effect on cell proliferation (against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer and Hek293 kidney cells), cell invasion and effect on CD82 expression in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells. Selected extracts were further evaluated for in vivo anti-angiogenesis. RESULTS: Extracts displayed varying antiproliferative activity against the different cell lines, and those that showed selectivity indexes (SI) > 0.5 against MDA-MB-231 were selected for anti-invasion evaluation.

Sojak (PS) displayed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 44.46 +/- 3.46, 74.00 +/- 4.48, 180.43 +/- 4.51, 96.97 +/- 2.29, 55.29 +/- 9.88 and 243.60 +/- 2.69 microg/mL, respectively against MDA-MB-231, and compared to Hek293 showed SI of 0.9, 0.7, 1.4, 1.1, 2.2 and 0.5. Significant invasion inhibition was observed at both 20 and 40 microg/mL for BS (94.10 +/- 0.74 and 96.73 +/- 0.95%) and CA (87.42 +/- 6.54 and 98.24 +/- 0.63%), whereas GR (14.91 +/- 1.62 and 41 +/- 1.78%) and PS (36.58 +/- 0.54 and 51.51 +/- 0.83%), only showed significant inhibition at 40 microg/mL, and FV (< 5% inhibition) and GP (10 +/- 1.03 and 22 +/- 1.31%) did not show significant inhibition at both concentrations. Due to the significant anti-invasive activity of BS, CA and PS at 40 microg/mL, these extracts were further evaluated for their potential to stimulate CD82. BS showed significant (p < 0.05) reduction in CD82 at 20 and 40 microg/mL (13.2 +/- 2.2% and 20.3 +/- 1.5% decrease, respectively), whereas both CA and PS at 20 microg/mL increased (p < 0.05) CD82 expression (16.4 +/- 0.8% and 5.4 +/- 0.6% increase, respectively), and at 40 microg/mL significantly reduced CD82 expression (23.4 +/- 3.1% and 11.2 +/- 2.9% decrease, respectively). Using the yolk sac membrane assay, BS (59.52 +/- 4.12 and 56.72 +/- 3.13% newly formed vessels) and CA (83.33 +/- 3.17 and 74.00 +/- 2.12%) at both 20 and 40 microg/egg showed significant (p < 0.001) angiogenesis inhibition, with BS showing statistical similar activity to the positive control, combretastatin A4 (10 nmol/egg), whereas PS only displayed significant (p < 0.001) angiogenesis stimulation at 40 microg/egg (120.81 +/- 3.34% newly formed vessels). CONCLUSION: BS exhibits antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and anti-angiogenic activity despite inhibiting CD82, suggesting an alternative mode of action. CA at 20 microg/mL shows moderate anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic potential by stimulating CD82, while at 40 microg/mL it still displays these properties but inhibits CD82, suggesting an additional mode of action. PS, with the least antiproliferative activity, stimulates CD82 and inhibits angiogenesis at 20 microg/mL but inhibits CD82 and increases angiogenesis at 40 microg/mL, indicating CD82 targeting as a major mode of action. Future studies should explore breast cancer xenograft models to assess the extracts' impact on CD82 expression and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, along with isolating bioactive compounds from the extracts.",

        "AB": "Endometriosis is a benign inflammatory onco-mimetic disease affecting 10-15% of women in the world. When it is refractory to medical treatments, surgery may be required. Usually, laparoscopy is the preferred approach, but robotic surgery has gained popularity in the last 15 years. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RAS) versus conventional laparoscopic surgery (LPS) in the treatment of endometriosis. This study adheres to PRISMA guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO. Studies reporting perioperative data comparing RAS and LPS surgery in patients with endometriosis querying PubMed, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov were included in the analysis. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool (QUADAS-2) was used for the quality assessment of the selected articles. Fourteen studies were identified, including 2709 patients with endometriosis stage I-IV for the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between RAS and LPS in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications, conversion rate and estimated blood loss. However, patients in the RAS group have a longer operative time (p < 0.0001) and longer hospital stay (p = 0.020) than those in the laparoscopic group. Robotic surgery is not inferior to laparoscopy in patients with endometriosis in terms of surgical outcomes; however, RAS requires longer operative times and longer hospital stay. The benefits of robotic surgery should be sought in the easiest potential integration of robotic platforms with new technologies. Prospective studies comparing laparoscopy to the new robotic systems are desirable for greater robustness of scientific evidence.",

HMGA2 overexpression is associated with breast cancer (BC) cell growth, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, HMGA2 expression is positively associated with poor prognosis of patients with BC, and inhibiting HMGA2 signaling can stimulate BC cell progression and metastasis. In this review, we focus on HMGA2 expression changes in BC tissues and multiple BC cell lines. Wnt/beta-catenin, STAT3, CNN6, and TRAIL-R2 proteins are upstream mediators of HMGA2 that can induce BC invasion and metastasis. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) can suppress BC cell growth, invasion, and metastasis by inhibiting HMGA2 expression. Furthermore, long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) and circular RNAs (CircRNAs) mainly regulate HMGA2 mRNA and protein expression levels by sponging miRNAs, thereby promoting BC development. Additionally, certain small molecule inhibitors can suppress BC drug resistance by reducing HMGA2 expression. Finally, we summarize findings demonstrating that HMGA2 siRNA and HMGA2 siRNA-loaded nanoliposomes can suppress BC progression and metastasis.",

This update provides new evidence on the efficacy of antiemetic regimens. METHODS: Guided by the Minds Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual of 2017, a rigorous approach was used to update the guidelines; a thorough literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2020. RESULTS: Comprehensive process resulted in the creation of 13 background questions (BQs), 12 clinical questions (CQs), and three future research questions (FQs). Moreover, the emetic risk classification was also updated. CONCLUSIONS: The primary goal of the present guidelines is to provide comprehensive information and facilitate informed decision-making, regarding antiemetic therapy, for both patients and healthcare providers.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Non-adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) in women with breast cancer is common and associated with medication side-effects and distress. We co-designed an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention (ACTION) to enhance medication decision-making and quality of life (QoL). We undertook a pilot trial of ACTION to inform the feasibility of a phase III trial, and to examine intervention acceptability. METHODS: This was a multi-site, exploratory, two-arm, individually randomised external pilot trial. Women with early breast cancer prescribed AET were randomised (1:1) to receive usual care (UC) or UC + ACTION. The ACTION intervention comprised a remotely delivered one-to-one ACT session followed by three group sessions delivered by clinical psychologists, alongside a website containing ideas for the self-management of side effects. RESULTS: Of the 480 women screened for eligibility, 260 (54.2%) were approached and 79 (30.4%) randomised. 71 (89.9%) women provided data at 3-month and 70 (88.6%) at 6-month 40 women were randomised to receive UC + ACTION and 32 (80.0%) completed the intervention. Most (75.0%) accessed the website at least once. ACTION was acceptable to participants (Borkovec & Nau Scale: mean = 7.8 [SD = 2.7] out of 10). Signals of effectiveness in favour of the UC + ACTION arm were observed for medication adherence (Adherence Starts with Knowledge questionnaire-12), QoL (work and social adjustment scale), health-related QoL (functional assessment of cancer therapy[FACT] general and FACT-ES-19/23), distress (generalised anxiety disorder -7, patient health questionnaire-9) and psychological flexibility (valuing questionnaire). CONCLUSIONS: The ACTION intervention was acceptable to patients. There were promising signals for effectiveness on primary and secondary outcomes. A phase III randomised controlled trial is feasible.

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: We previously reported that postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer (BC) receiving adjuvant anastrozole 1 mg/day (ANA1) with estrone (E1) >/=1.3 pg/mL and estradiol (E2) >/=0.5 (inadequate estrogen suppression [IES]) had a 3.0-fold increased risk of a BC event. The objective of this study was to determine if increasing anastrozole to 10 mg/day (ANA10) could result in adequate estrogen suppression (AES: E1 <1.3 pg/mL and/or E2 <0.5) among those with IES on ANA1. METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ BC planning to receive adjuvant ANA1 were eligible. E1 and E2 were assessed pre- and post-8-10 weeks of ANA1. Those with IES were switched to 8-10 week cycles of ANA10 followed by letrozole 2.5 mg/day. E1 and E2 were assessed after each cycle. Anastrozole concentrations were measured post-ANA1 and post-ANA10. Primary analyses included patients who documented taking at least 80% of planned treatment (adherent cohort). RESULTS: 132 (84.6%) of 156 eligible patients were ANA1-adherent. IES occurred in 40 (30.3%) adherent patients. 25 (78.1%) of 32 patients who began ANA10 were adherent, and AES was achieved in 19 (76.0%; 90%CI: 58.1-89.0%) patients. Anastrozole concentrations post-ANA1 and post-ANA10 did not differ by estrogen suppression status among adherent patients. AES was maintained/attained in 21 (91.3%) of 23 letrozole-adherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30% of ANA1-adherent patients had IES. Among those who switched to ANA10 and were adherent, 76% had AES. Further studies are required to validate emerging data that ANA1 results in IES for some patients and to determine the clinical benefit of switching to ANA10 or an alternative AI.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous and aggressive cancer. Although our previous study classified primary TNBC into four subtypes, comprehensive longitudinal investigations are lacking. METHODS: We assembled a large-scale, real-world cohort comprised of 880 TNBC patients [465 early-stage TNBC (eTNBC) and 415 metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) patients] who were treated at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The longitudinal dynamics of TNBC subtypes during disease progression were elucidated in this patient cohort. Comprehensive analysis was performed to compare primary and metastatic lesions within specific TNBC subtypes. RESULTS: The recurrence and metastasis rates within 3 years after initial diagnosis in the eTNBC cohort were 10.1% (47/465). The median overall survival (OS) in the mTNBC cohort was 27.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 24.4-30.2 months], which indicated a poor prognosis. The prognostic significance of the original molecular subtypes in both eTNBC and mTNBC patients was confirmed. Consistent molecular subtypes were maintained in 77.5% of the patients throughout disease progression with the mesenchymal-like (MES) subtype demonstrating a tendency for subtype transition and brain metastasis. Additionally, a precision treatment strategy based on the metastatic MES subtype of target lesions resulted in improved progression-free survival in the FUTURE trial. CONCLUSIONS: Our longitudinal study comprehensively revealed the clinical characteristics and survival of patients with the original TNBC subtypes and validated the consistency of most molecular subtypes throughout disease progression. However, we emphasize the major importance of repeat pathologic confirmation of the MES subtype.",

        "AB": "Recent studies have reported a higher than expected risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and a single dose of electron beam intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). This finding was the rationale to perform a retrospective single center cohort study evaluating the oncologic results of consecutive patients treated with BCS and IORT. Women were eligible if they had clinical low-risk (N0, </=2 cm unifocal, Bloom and Richardson grade 1-2), estrogen receptor-positive and human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2-negative breast cancer. Prior to BCS, pN0 status was determined by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Data on oncologic follow-up were analyzed. Between 2012 and 2019, 306 consecutive patients were treated and analyzed, with a median age of 67 (50-86) years at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 60 (8-120) months. Five-year cumulative risk of IBTR was 13.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.4-17.4). True in field recurrence was present in 3.9% of the patients. In 4.6% of the patients, the IBRT was classified as a local recurrence due to seeding of tumor cells in the cutis or subcutis most likely related to percutaneous biopsy. In 2.9% of the patients, the IBRT was a new outfield primary tumor. Three patients had a regional lymph node recurrence and two had distant metastases as first event. One breast cancer-related death was observed. Estimated 5-year overall survival was 89.8% (95% CI 86.0-93.6). In conclusion, although some of IBTR cases could have been prevented by adaptations in biopsy techniques and patient selection, BCS followed by IORT was associated with a substantial risk of IBTR.",

Recognizing the limited educational resources available for breast and plastic surgeons concerning mastectomy techniques that emphasize nerve preservation, our study sought to bridge this gap. Specifically, we aimed to provide a comprehensive exploration of the surgical applied anatomy of breast sensory innervation and a detailed, step-by-step guide for incorporating nerve-sparing mastectomy and breast neurotization into clinical practice. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance the understanding and implementation of nerve-preserving techniques in mastectomy procedures, contributing to improved patient outcomes and quality of life post surgery. We hope that by familiarizing breast and reconstructive surgeons with this procedure, we can gain momentum in our research efforts and ultimately enhance the care provided to mastectomy patients.",

        "AB": "Background Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment and minimizing mortality, requiring effective screening methods like self-examination, clinical examination, and mammography. However, not all women in Saudi Arabia comply with these examinations, and studies examining its practice and barriers of low uptake are scant. The aim of this study is to investigate factors influencing breast cancer screening behavior among women in Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study involving 806 women from October to November 2022 used an online questionnaire for the data collection process, including questions about demographic characteristics, awareness assessment, breast cancer screening behavior, symptoms, risk factors, and screening programs. Factors affecting the screening behavior were analyzed using the logistic regression model with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Among the 806 women who participated in the study, 479 (59.4%) were under 40 years old, and half of them were urban residents (n = 394, 48.9%). Only 134 subjects (16.6%) had a history of breast screening. Social media (n = 519, 64.5%) was the predominant source of screening information. The primary obstacles to breast cancer screening were the absence of tumor symptoms (n = 333, 41.3%), insufficient knowledge about early detection (n = 249, 31%), lack of time (n = 245, 30%), fear of discovering a tumor (n = 187, 23%), and lack of awareness about screening centers (n = 155, 19%). In regression analysis, predictive factors for breast cancer screening behavior were as follows: age over 40 years old (AOR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.70-3.87), residents of big cities (AOR: 3.57; 95% CI: 1.02-12.56), positive family history of breast cancer (AOR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.50-4.28), proximity to the screening center (AOR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.22-5.39), and using contraceptive pills for more than five years (AOR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.04-3.04), and were statistically significant (all p-values < 0.05). Conclusions In this study, the most perceived barriers to BSE were the absence of tumor symptoms, followed by insufficient knowledge about early detection, lack of time, fear of discovering a tumor, and lack of awareness about screening centers. Additionally, the predictive factors for breast cancer screening behavior were as follows: age over 40 years old, residents of big cities, positive family history of breast cancer, proximity to the screening center, and using contraceptive pills for more than five years. Given the identified factors affecting breast self-examination behavior in this study, public education initiatives are crucial for raising awareness, facilitating self-examination, and ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing breast cancer treatment costs in society.",

Here we explored the effects of severely compromised respiration on the metastatic capability of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. METHODS: 4T1 cell lines with different levels of respiratory capacity were generated; the Seahorse extracellular flux analyser was used to evaluate oxygen consumption rates, fluorescent confocal microscopy to assess the number of SYBR gold-stained mitochondrial DNA nucleoids, and the presence of the ATP5B protein in the cytoplasm and fluorescent in situ nuclear hybridization was used to establish ploidy. MinION nanopore RNA sequence analysis was used to compare mitochondrial DNA transcription between cell lines. Orthotopic injection was used to determine the ability of cells to metastasize to the lungs of female Balb/c mice. RESULTS: OXPHOS-deficient ATP5B-KO3.1 cells did not generate primary tumours. Severely OXPHOS compromised rho(0)D5 cells generated both primary tumours and lung metastases. Cells generated from lung metastasis of both OXPHOS-competent and OXPHOS-compromised cells formed primary tumours but no metastases when re-injected into mice. OXPHOS-compromised cells significantly increased their mtDNA content, but this did not result in increased OXPHOS capacity, which was not due to decreased mtDNA transcription. Gene set enrichment analysis suggests that certain cells derived from lung metastases downregulate their epithelial-to-mesenchymal related pathways. CONCLUSION: In summary, OXPHOS is required for tumorigenesis in this orthotopic mouse breast cancer model but even very low levels of OXPHOS are sufficient to generate both primary tumours and lung metastases.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a major health challenge globally, ranking as the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality among women, despite advancements in cancer detection and treatment. In this study, we identified four novel compounds from marine organisms that effectively target and inhibit the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), crucial for BC cell growth and proliferation. These compounds not only induced early apoptosis through Caspase-3 activation but also showed significant inhibitory effects on EGFR mutations associated with drug resistance (T790M, L858R, and L858R/T790M), demonstrating high EGFR kinase selectivity. Cell Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) experiments indicated that Tandyukisin stabilizes EGFR in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, binding competition assays using surface plasmon resonance technology revealed that Tandyukisin and Trichoharzin bound to distinct sites on EGFR and that their combined use enhanced apoptosis in BC cells. This discovery may pave the way for developing new marine-derived EGFR inhibitors, offering a promising avenue for innovative cancer treatment strategies and addressing EGFR-mediated drug resistance.",

We investigated the antitumor activity of the crude ethanolic extract of the fungus Trichoderma asperelloides (ExtTa) and its interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs. It was observed, by MTT cytotoxicity assay, that ExtTa significantly reduced cell viability in breast adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, lung carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, and sarcomas cell lines. The highest efficacy and selectivity of ExtTa were found against glioblastoma T98G and colorectal HCT116 cell lines. ExtTa is approximately four times more cytotoxic to those tumor cells than to non-cancer cell lines. A synergistic effect between ExtTa and doxorubicin was found in the treatment of osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, as well as with 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells using CompuSyn software. Our data unravel the presence of bioactive compounds with cytotoxic effects against cancer cells present in T. asperelloides ethanolic crude extract, with the potential for developing novel anticancer agents.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The first-line treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) involves a combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (TPH). This study assessed the efficacy of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PH) in routine practice, following the treatment protocols of Uruguay's National Resources Fund (FNR), akin to clinical trials. METHODS: Patients with advanced MBC treated with PH between 2008 and 2022 per FNR protocols were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meyer method and log-rank test were utilized for analyzing overall survival (OS). Demographic and clinical variables, including age, menopausal status, and hormone receptors (HR), were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 318 PH-treated patients. The median age was 56 years, with 63.2% being postmenopausal and 60.4% HR and HER-2 positive. With a median follow-up of 17.2 months, the median OS was 29 months. OS varied based on HR status and the presence of metastases at different sites, significantly lower in patients with brain, cutaneous/subcutaneous, and pulmonary metastases. Additionally, OS was higher in patients treated at private institutions compared to public ones. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the disparity in oncological treatment efficacy between clinical trials and clinical reality in Uruguay, emphasizing the importance of authentic environment research for more representative and effective medicine in Latin America.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study examined cancer mortality trends in Brazil from 1979 to 2021, emphasizing breast and prostate cancers. METHODS: Utilizing data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, it analyzed cancer deaths nationally and regionally, highlighting gender-specific and regional disparities. RESULTS: The research finds that cancer death rates have been growing at an average of 12% per year, contrasting with the population growth rate of 2.2%. This trend is more pronounced in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. A comparison of cancer mortality rates between Brazil, the USA, and China reveals that while the Brazilian and Chinese rates exhibit slower growth, the US rate shows a continuous decline since the 1990s. CONCLUSIONS: The study adopts a novel approach by focusing on growth rates and employing polynomial interpolation, revealing a deceleration in cancer death growth over the last 15 years across all malignant neoplasms. The study also contextualizes these findings within Brazil's cancer control policies, tracing the evolution of preventive measures and treatment advancements. It highlights the significant role of the National Cancer Institute and the Unified Health System in implementing effective strategies. The decreasing trend in cancer mortality rates in Brazil, despite population growth, illustrates the effectiveness of comprehensive cancer control and prevention measures, underlining their importance in public health policy.",

        "AB": "Desmoid fibromatosis of the breast (also known as desmoid tumor of the breast) is a rare entity infrequently encountered by oncologists and surgeons caring for patients with breast disease. The current body of literature is highly reliant on case series and extrapolations from other sites of desmoid tumor-related disease. Much remains unclear regarding the pathological origins, natural history, and response to treatment of this condition. Traditional treatment strategies have centered on surgical resection, which may result in significantly disfiguring cosmetic and functional outcomes, frequent need for re-operation, and associated morbidity. There are limited data to support the superiority of upfront surgical resection when compared to medical therapy or watchful waiting strategies. Current treatment guidelines for desmoid tumors do not focus on the breast as a site of disease and are purposefully ambiguous due to the paucity of evidence available. We aim to review the literature concerning desmoid fibromatosis of the breast and propose an algorithm for current evidence-based management of this rare disease in the context of our experience with this pathology at a high-volume quaternary referral center.",

An association between Poland syndrome and breast cancer has been reported, but no clear etiological link between Poland syndrome and breast tumors has been established. We report a case of Poland syndrome combined with breast cancer and analyzed the clinical features of breast cancer in this case and its influence on the choice of treatment for breast cancer. CASE DESCRIPTION: In February 2022, we admitted a 47-year-old woman with Poland syndrome involving the right limb combined with right-sided breast cancer. After admission, the patient was given eight cycles of neoadjuvant therapy and underwent a modified radical mastectomy on September 7, 2022. Absence of right pectoralis major muscle and pectoralis minor muscle, thoracic deformity, and an adhesive band along the side of the sternum to the right axilla were observed during the operation. After surgery, the incision achieved grade-A healing, and the targeted therapy was continued for 1 year. The patient was followed up for 8 months after surgery, and the limb function of the affected side recovered well, and no obvious subcutaneous effusion, flap necrosis, upper limb edema, and other complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomic variation of patients with Poland syndrome has some influence on the selection of surgical methods for breast cancer, but whether it would affect the prognosis of patients is unknown. To clarify the relationship between Poland syndrome and breast cancer, we need more cases to conduct etiological studies in the future.",

        "AB": "Recently, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer (BC) has emerged as a novel subset within the category of HER2-negative BC, prompting a reassessment of the immunohistochemical negative scores of 0, 1+, and the 2+/in situ hybridization (ISH) negative phenotype. Recent clinical trials have provided compelling evidence of the substantial clinical advantages offered by novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that target HER2 in the treatment of these specific tumor cohorts. Notably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd), an ADC that specifically targets HER2, has recently received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration as the inaugural targeted therapeutic option for HER2-low BC. However, the classification of HER2-low BC as a distinct subtype, the methods for detecting HER2-low BC, and the optimal treatment approach for HER2-low BC remain subjects of ongoing debate and lack consensus. This comprehensive review aims to address these pertinent concerns, offering insights into the nuanced tumor biology underlying HER2-low BC and critically analyzing the current treatment pathways available. By synthesizing available evidence, the objective is to contribute to an enhanced understanding of HER2-low BC, providing a foundation for more informed clinical decisions and further advancements in tailored therapeutic approaches. As the medical community navigates these uncertainties, this review seeks to consolidate existing knowledge, fostering a collective effort toward establishing consensus in the diagnosis and treatment of HER2-low BC.",

        "AB": "For patients with operable breast cancer, neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) can be used to downstage the primary tumor in the breast and to facilitate breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with large tumors who desire breast conservation. Rates of breast pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are highest in patients with triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (HER2(+)) disease; however, achieving pCR is not necessary for successful downstaging and avoidance of mastectomy, and rates of conversion to BCS-eligibility are high across all receptor subtypes. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) can be used instead of NAC in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive (HR(+))/HER2 negative (HER2(-)) breast cancer to downstage the breast, particularly when the patient has no clear indication for systemic chemotherapy, but desires breast conservation. In patients treated with NET, rates of conversion to BCS-eligibility are similar to rates observed with NAC. The oncologic safety of BCS after NAC and NET has been established in prospective trials, and local recurrence (LR) rates are acceptably low provided negative surgical margins can be obtained. Investigation is under way to determine the feasibility and safety of omitting breast surgery in patients with responsive subtypes who have no residual invasive or in situ disease identified on post-treatment tumor bed biopsies; however, the significant risk of missing residual disease-which may impact selection of adjuvant systemic therapy-may preclude future adoption of this approach.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is often indicated in the treatment of breast cancer following breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, yet carries a 95% risk of radiation dermatitis (RD) of varying severity within 1 to 4 weeks of treatment. The burdens of RT include skin breakdown, pain, psychological distress, and functional challenges. Given limited patient education regarding the prevention and management of RD, a Clinician Guide and Evidence-based Skin Care Plan were developed to offer a holistic, patient-centered approach to care, with optimal RD prevention and management strategies to enhance patients' quality of life and survival. CASE DESCRIPTION: M.R. (a pseudonym) was a 64-year-old Caucasian woman, diagnosed with invasive adenocarcinoma of the left breast, underwent a lumpectomy with a positive sentinel node biopsy. Within 4 weeks of surgery, she received RT, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Within 1 week, the skin of her breast and axilla was red and hyperpigmented with skin damage progressing to dryness, itching and flaking. At this point, she asked the Radiology team for a skin care protocol to prevent or reduce RD, but limited information was provided. Ultimately, her skin cracked, blistered and crusted, with the development of a skin infection. She expressed the significant impact on her physical, emotional and functional well-being, and lamented about the shortfalls in her care, specifically the limited availability of information to prevent and reduce RD. CONCLUSIONS: In order to prevent and minimize RD and to promote health, this case study highlights the need for an all-encompassing, patient-centered approach to care, which may be achievable by implementation of a Clinician Guide and an Evidence-based Skin Care Plan. Highlighted in the Clinician Guide are the importance of developing a trustworthy patient-clinician relationship, emotional support, social support, education, weekly physical assessments, assessment of overall adjustment to a cancer diagnosis and treatment, promotion of patient engagement and self-care, reinforcement of healthy lifestyles, and patient adherence to the Evidence-based Skin Care Plan during RT. These strategies are expected to decrease the physical, mental, and functional difficulties associated with RT, avoid treatment delays or discontinuation, and increase the likelihood of disease-free survival and quality of life.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Significant progress has been made in immunotherapy of breast cancer (BC) with the approval of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in early and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) settings. Most guidelines have recommended immune therapy as the important approach in BC, yet several critical aspects still require further clarification, including proper patient selection, treatment duration, optimized chemotherapy partner, predictive biomarkers, and specific considerations for Chinese patients. METHODS: (I) Establishment of expert group: the expert group consists of 32 experts from departments such as medical oncology, breast surgery, and pathology; (II) literature search: mainly conducted in English databases (such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine disc, and Wanfang Database), with a search cutoff date of April 23, 2024; (III) assessment of evidence quality and recommendation strength: evidence quality and recommendation opinions are graded based on the evidence category and recommendation level of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines; (IV) consensus formulation: on the March 2, 2024, through online consensus meeting, the consensus content is thoroughly discussed, and opinions from all experts are solicited. RESULTS: The consensus meeting has resulted in 15 detailed recommendations, providing clearer guidance on the clinical application of immunotherapy in BC management. The core suggestions are as follows: for early-stage II-III TNBC and metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) in the first-line setting, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors can be considered. However, for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC (HR(+)/HER2(-) BC), HER2(+) BC, and mTNBC in later lines of therapy, evidence is lacking to support the use of immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus provides a comprehensive overview of BC immunotherapy, including immunotherapy for early-stage BC and late-stage BC, immune related adverse event (irAE) management, biomarkers of immunotherapy, and future directions. The consensus consolidates these deliberations into 15 evidence-based recommendations, serving as a practical guide for clinicians to more scientifically and systematically manage the clinical application of immunotherapy.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The current study shows that the incidence rate of triple-negative breast cancer accounts for 10-17% of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. There is no specific treatment target, the age of onset is relatively small, and the recurrence rate is relatively fast. The prognosis of breast cancer in different subtypes is the most unsatisfactory, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. We report a typical case of metastatic advanced triple-negative breast cancer who responded well to apatinib mesylate after chemotherapy failure and achieved significant progression-free survival, which is relatively rare in triple-negative breast cancer with limited treatment means. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old female was surgically diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancer on April 17, 2015. After surgery, she had lung metastasis after standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After receiving the NX regimen (vinorelbine, capecitabine) for 8 cycles, she progressed. Because the patient refused later, she was adjusted to apatinib mesylate, and serious adverse reactions occurred during the treatment process. By adjusting the drug dose, and low-dose apatinib treatment, the lung lesions were close to complete response (CR), reaching a progression-free survival period of 45 months. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose apatinib may be a promising anti-tumor drug for triple-negative breast cancer patients, which needs more samples to verify. This case may provide a reference for the treatment selection of triple-negative metastatic breast cancer in the future.",

TORCHLIGHT is the first phase III trial of PD-1 inhibitor combined chemotherapy in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in China, evaluating the efficacy and safety of toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel as first- or second-line therapy. Nab-paclitaxel has significant advantages over other chemotherapy drugs, as paclitaxel nanoparticles combine with natural albumin to increase drug delivery and bioavailability of paclitaxel. Firstly, nab-paclitaxel has a higher therapy response; Secondly, albumin carries paclitaxel out of the blood circulation faster, reducing the damage to normal tissues, ensuring the survival of more normal immune cells and exerting immune efficacy. Finally, nab-paclitaxel does not cause allergic reactions caused by organic solvents and does not require glucocorticoid pretreatment, avoiding immune suppression and ensuring the maximum efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In TORCHLIGHT trial, 95% of subjects were on the first line treatment, with only 5% being on the second line, and 56% patients were programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive in total population. It achieved the survival benefits of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) dual efficacy end points, which stood out among numerous ICIs in advanced TNBC. TORCHLIGHT trial, as the name of it, like a torch to more patients with advanced TNBC, lighting up their lives. We described the design background of TORCHLIGHT trial and reviewed primary trials of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor in advanced TNBC both domestically and internationally.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While the axillary nodal basin is the most common lymphatic drainage pathway of the breast, the internal mammary (IM) lymph node chain plays a significant role in breast cancer staging and treatment. It has been identified as sentinel nodal drainage in approximately 13-37% of patients. Despite this, the data is still limited with regard to diagnosis and management when there is suspicion or confirmation of IM lymph node (IMLN) involvement by metastatic breast cancer. The objective of this publication is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current body of literature surrounding the diagnosis, management and prognostic value of IMLNs in breast cancer treatment. METHODS: Review of the literature published regarding IMLN diagnosis, significance, and management was completed in PubMed. Additional focus was placed on reviewing articles published within the past 10 years as foundation for an update regarding the current practice and future directions in this space. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Improved imaging techniques, with positron emission tomography-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have led to increase in the identification of IM lymphadenopathy, yielding surgical staging of the IM nodes nearly obsolete. While IM nodal metastases may play a role in overall survival (OS), it has not been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for increased locoregional recurrence. IM nodal irradiation (IMNI) therapy has been a mainstay in the treatment of IM disease in the context of breast cancer. IMNI has demonstrated improvement in OS and risk of distant recurrence. Wide variations in radiation practices for patients with IM lymphadenopathy exist internationally, highlighting the lack of clear data driven consensus guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we provide an updated assessment of the current diagnosis, clinical significance, and management of IM lymphadenopathy for breast cancer patients.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cancer immunotherapy has significantly advanced the field of oncology, providing novel therapeutic strategies for various malignancies, including breast cancer. The programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway is pivotal in immune regulation, and its inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic benefits in diverse tumors. This review aims to critically examine the role, clinical efficacy, safety, and future directions of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment, with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and tislelizumab, and to elucidate the challenges and prospects in this dynamic field. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted, adhering to Narrative Review reporting checklist for transparent reporting. Data from selected studies were qualitatively analyzed to synthesize key findings related to the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and challenges of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: PD-1 inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in various malignancies, including advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where they have been investigated both in combination with chemotherapy and as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment. The exploration of these inhibitors in other breast cancer subtypes, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, is ongoing. The review highlights the challenges in patient selection, management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and the emergence of resistance mechanisms. It underscores the need for ongoing research focusing on identifying reliable predictive biomarkers, elucidating mechanisms of resistance, and optimizing treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors hold substantial promise in advancing breast cancer treatment. This review provides critical insights and emphasizes the clinical importance of continued scientific exploration to refine patient selection criteria, improve treatment outcomes, and expand the applications of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Further research is imperative to overcome the existing challenges and realize the full therapeutic potential of these inhibitors in breast cancer and other malignancies.",

        "AB": "Liquid biopsy has emerged as a crucial tool in managing breast cancer (BC) patients, offering a minimally invasive approach to detect circulating tumor biomarkers. Until recently, the majority of the studies in BC focused on evaluating a single liquid biopsy analyte, primarily circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Despite the proven prognostic and predictive value of CTCs, their low abundance when detected using enrichment methods, especially in the early stages, poses a significant challenge. It is becoming evident that combining diverse circulating biomarkers, each representing different facets of tumor biology, has the potential to enhance the management of patients with BC. This article emphasizes the importance of considering these biomarkers as complementary/synergistic rather than competitive, recognizing their ability to contribute to a comprehensive disease profile. The review provides an overview of the clinical significance of simultaneously analyzing CTCs and other biomarkers, including cell-free circulating DNA, extracellular vesicles, non-canonical CTCs, cell-free RNAs, and non-malignant cells. Such a comprehensive liquid biopsy approach holds promise not only in BC but also in other cancer types, offering opportunities for early detection, prognostication, and therapy monitoring. However, addressing associated challenges, such as refining detection methods and establishing standardized protocols, is crucial for realizing the full potential of liquid biopsy in transforming our understanding and approach to BC. As the field evolves, collaborative efforts will be instrumental in unlocking the revolutionary impact of liquid biopsy in BC research and management.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in women worldwide and one of the leading causes of female death. The triple-negative subtype, characterized by the absence of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tends to occur in younger patients, be more aggressive and less differentiated. Furthermore, this subtype is considered the most immunogenic and associated with higher levels of tumor cell infiltration, mainly lymphocytes. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play a crucial role in the interaction of the host's immune system and cancer cells. The microenvironment is critical in tumor development and progression. Assessment of infiltrating lymphocytes can provide valuable information about the immune response and, given the lack of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes in triple-negative tumors and can be considered as a potential biomarker. Some evidence suggests that higher levels of these lymphocytes are associated with better responses to systemic treatment, longer progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). However, treatment escalation or de-escalation strategies for triple-negative BC (TNBC) currently do not consider the presence or density of TILs for therapeutic decisions. TILs appear to be useful predictive and prognostic indicators. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these relationships and integrate TILs as a biomarker consistently into clinical practice. This article summarizes key concepts relating to the role of the immune infiltrate in BC, along with the current status and future prospects regarding TILs as a predictive and prognostic biomarker.",

        "AB": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a subtype of breast cancer that does not express the three major prognostic receptors of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progesterone (PR), and estrogen (ER). This limits treatment options and results in a high rate of mortality. We have reported previously on the efficacy of a water-soluble, cationic organometallic compound (Ru-IM) in a TNBC mouse xenograft model with impressive tumor reduction and targeted tumor drug accumulation. Ru-IM inhibits cancer hallmarks such as migration, angiogenesis, and invasion in TNBC cells by a mechanism that generates apoptotic cell death. Ru-IM displays little interaction with DNA and appears to act by a P53-independent pathway. We report here on the mitochondrial alterations caused by Ru-IM treatment and detail the inhibitory properties of Ru-IM in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Lastly, we describe the results of an efficacy study of the TNBC xenografted mouse model with Ru-IM and Olaparib monotherapy and combinatory treatments. We find 59% tumor shrinkage with Ru-IM and 65% with the combination. Histopathological analysis confirmed no test-article-related toxicity. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated an inhibition of the angiogenic marker CD31 and increased levels of apoptotic cleaved caspase 3 marker, along with a slight inhibition of p-mTOR. Taken together, the effects of Ru-IM in vitro show similar trends and translation in vivo. Our investigation underscores the therapeutic potential of Ru-IM in addressing the challenges posed by TNBC as evidenced by its robust efficacy in inhibiting key cancer hallmarks, substantial tumor reduction, and minimal systemic toxicity.",

        "AB": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) typically manifests as higher invasive carcinoma correlated with a worse prognosis that primarily relies on chemotherapy. There is growing evidence that nitric oxide (NO) donor drugs have the potential for anticancer therapy. On this basis, we constructed and evaluated a novel coumarin-furoxan hybrid 4A93 as an effective antitumor candidate drug. 4A93 exhibits low IC(50) values in three TNBC cell lines and inhibits colony formation and DNA synthesis, probably due to the release of high concentrations of NO in mitochondria, which induces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Further research suggests that 4A93 might destroy mitochondria by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and promoting the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Intrinsic apoptosis is induced finally, along with Akt/Erk signaling suppression. Additionally, 4A93 underregulates the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition process to inhibit cell migration and invasion. In 4T1 subcutaneous and hematogenous models of mice, 4A93 therapy suppresses the tumor growth and prevented lung metastasis with favorable biosafety. Our results provide insights into 4A93 in TNBC treatment and validate the contribution of NO donors in tumor therapy.",

        "AB": "Survivin, a cancer-cell-specific multifunctional protein, is regulated by many oncogenic signaling pathways and an effective therapeutic target. Although, several types of survivin-targeting agents have been developed over the past few decades, none of them received clinical approval. This could be because survivin expression is tightly controlled by the feedback interaction between different signaling molecules. Of the several signaling pathways that are known to regulate survivin expression, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT serine-threonine kinase/forkhead boxO (PI3K/AKT/FoxO) pathway is well-known for feedback loops constructed by cross-talk among different molecules. Using sepantronium bromide (YM155), the first of its class of survivin-suppressant, we uncovered the existence of an interesting cross-talk between Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) and FoxO transcription factors that also contributes to YM155 resistance in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Pharmacological manipulation to interrupt this interaction not only helped restore/enhance the drug-sensitivity but also prompted effective immune clearance of cancer cells. Because the YM155-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiates this feedback, we believe that it will be occurring for many ROS-producing chemotherapeutic agents. Our work provides a rational explanation for the poor efficacy of YM155 compared to standard chemotherapy in clinical trials. Finally, the triple drug combination approach used herein might help reintroducing YM155 into the clinical pipeline, and given the high survivin expression in TNBC cells in general, it could be effective in treating this subtype of breast cancer.",

        "AB": "The B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins plays a vital role in tumorigenesis. Cancer cells utilize the expression of Bcl-2 to evade therapy and develop resistance. Bcl-2 overexpression also causes cancer cells to be more invasive and metastatic. About 80% of cancer deaths are due to metastases, and yet targeted therapies for metastatic cancers are scarce. We discovered a small molecule, BFC1103, which changes the conformation of Bcl-2 to convert the antiapoptotic protein to a proapoptotic protein. BFC1103-induced apoptosis is dependent on the expression levels of Bcl-2, with higher levels causing more apoptosis. BFC1103 suppressed the growth of breast cancer lung metastasis. BFC1103 has the potential for further optimization and development for clinical testing in metastatic cancers that express Bcl-2. This study demonstrates a new approach to target Bcl-2 using a small molecule, BFC1103, to suppress metastatic disease.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is an emerging therapy that bestows advanced breast tumors with encouraging clinical activity and manageable toxicity; however, the outcomes of phase 2/3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are heterogeneous. Our study aims to assess the clinical utilities [i.e., objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)], and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of ADC monotherapy (defined as the study cohort) versus the therapy of physician's choice (TPC) (defined as the control cohort) in participants with advanced breast tumors. METHODS: We conducted a computerized retrieval to identify RCTs from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov until April 4(th), 2023. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were involved, with 5,089 unique patients. A binary random-effect model Mantel-Haenszel method was employed to pool data due to the considerable heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidential interval (CI) of ORR and CBR. The secondary outcome measure represented hazard ratio (HR) of PFS and OS and OR of the frequency of any grade/grade >/=3 AEs. The pooled results showed an insignificant difference of ORR (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 0.86-3.13; P=0.136) and CBR (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 0.89-2.31; P=0.142) in the study cohort than the control cohort. The pooled effect on PFS (HR =0.62; 95% CI: 0.50-0.74; P<0.001) and on OS (HR =0.70; 95% CI: 0.57-0.83; P<0.001) both indicated a significant superiority of the study cohort. The frequency of any grade AEs (OR =1.03; 95% CI: 0.75-1.41; P=0.849) and that of grade >/=3 AEs (OR =0.83; 95% CI: 0.57-1.21; P=0.342) were both observed a nonsignificant difference between the cohorts. These domains, i.e., allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment, had the high risk of bias over 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to physician's choice, ADC monotherapy overall confirms a considerable refinement in survival benefits plus a similar safety profile in advanced breast tumors.",

However, no clinical data has been reported on which of the two strategies is more effective. In order to explore optimal treatment option post-CDK4/6i, we performed a retrospective comparative cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib-based therapy versus tucidinostat-based therapy after progression on palbociclib. METHODS: We identified patients with HR(+)HER2(-) MBC who had received abemaciclib-based therapy or tucidinostat-based therapy after progression on palbociclib from the database of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer (CSCO BC). Baseline characteristics, efficacy and safety information of treatments were derived from seven research centers' medical records. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (CBR), PFS according to PIK3CA gene type, and safety. RESULTS: Between April 1(st) 2020 and June 30(th) 2022, a total of 149 patients were included, of whom 73 patients received abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (ET), and 76 patients received tucidinostat plus ET. The majority of patients had visceral disease (124/149, 83.2%) and >/=3 metastatic organs (76/149, 51.0%), one third (48/149, 32.2%) had previously been treated >/=3 lines of ET at baseline in MBC setting. CBR was 38.4% (28/73) in abemaciclib group and 17.1% (13/76) in tucidinostat group (P=0.004). There was significant difference in PFS between abemaciclib group and tucidinostat group in both the whole population (5.0 vs. 2.0 months; hazard ratio =0.44; 95% CI: 0.31-0.64; P<0.001) and propensity score matched population. PIK3CA mutations occurred in 44.20% of patients who had undergone multigene sequencing. PIK3CA-mutant showed a negative effect on PFS of abemaciclib-based therapy. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event in both groups for any grade and grades 3-4. Common non-hematological toxicity occurred in abemaciclib group was diarrhea (27.4%), and were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (26.3%), nausea (25.0%), vomiting (11.8%) and hypokalemia (13.2%) in tucidinostat group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests superiority of abemaciclib-based therapy over tucidinostat-based therapy in patients progressed on palbociclib, which merits further assessment in larger and prospective trials.",

To allow for breast conservation in patients with large invasive tumors and poor response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) or patients with extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (OPBCS) techniques are introduced. OPBCS allows for breast conservation in a selective group of breast cancer patients who initially would have been treated with mastectomy due to the unfavorable tumor-to-breast ratio. With OPBCS, the oncological tumor excision is combined with plastic surgical breast conservation techniques without compromising oncological safety and maintaining aesthetic outcomes by preserving the shape of the breast. OPBCS should however not be applied to all breast cancer patients and the selection of patients who benefit from OPBCS and the timing of OPBCS are best discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Caution is required in patients with higher risk of positive margins [e.g., multifocal breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), larger tumors and DCIS]. In these patients, delayed OPBCS is recommended to facilitate re-excision and maintain excellent breast conserving rates. Despite proven benefits in selected patients, the increase in the adoption of OPBCS is relatively low. This article provides a clinical perspective on OPBCS.",

        "AB": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for predicting prognosis and effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer. The emergence of novel HER2 antibody-drug conjugate has led to a shift from the binary categorization of HER2 status (i.e., negative and positive) to a ternary categorization gradually (i.e., HER2 0, HER2 low expression and HER2 positive). The heterogeneity of HER2 low expression in breast cancer has also recently aroused widespread concern, and the heterogeneity of tumors has led to differences in the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify the HER2 expression status of breast cancer, which can provide a basis for patients to formulate personalized treatment strategies. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and been widely used in the pathological accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. The research results show that AI can significantly improve the consistency and accuracy of HER2 interpreted by pathologists in breast cancer. This has provoked many discussions on HER2-low breast cancer, such as quality control prior to HER2-low expression detection, the latest progress of tumor heterogeneity, and the application of AI. In this paper, we discuss the latest testing guidelines and advances on HER2-low breast cancer, aiming to standardize and improve the pathological testing of HER2-low breast cancer.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women, accounting for approximately 30% of all new cancer cases. The prognosis of breast cancer heavily depends on the stage of diagnosis, with early detection resulting in higher survival rates. Various risk factors, including family history, alcohol consumption and hormone exposure, contribute to breast cancer development. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of certain receptors, is particularly aggressive and heterogeneous. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), abnormal dilations of small blood vessels in the brain, is contributed by mutated genes like CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 through the perturbed formation of the CCM signaling complex (CSC). The CSC-non-classic membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs)-progesterone (PRG) (CmP)/CSC-mPRs-PRG-classic nuclear progesterone receptors (nPRs) (CmPn) signaling network, which integrates the CSC with mPRs and nPRs, plays a role in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Understanding these pathways can provide insights into potential treatments. This paper focuses on the emerging field of CmPn/CmP signal networks, which involve PRG, its receptors (nPRs and mPRs), and the CSC. These networks play a role in tumorigenesis, particularly in TNBCs. Aims to deliver a thorough examination of the CmP/CmPn pathways concerning TNBCs, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of these pathways, explores their applications and highlights their significance in the context of TNBCs.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The ACE study previously demonstrated that tucidinostat (chidamide), a subtype-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, plus exemestane significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer patients with a manageable safety profile. The analysis of long-term safety and overall survival (OS) is presented here. METHODS: ACE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial comparing tucidinostat 30 mg/twice weekly plus exemestane 25 mg/day versus placebo plus exemestane 25 mg/day in postmenopausal patients with advanced, HR(+) breast cancer. The primary endpoint was PFS, and OS was the secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Of the 365 patients enrolled between July 2015, and June 2017, 244 were assigned to tucidinostat plus exemestane (tucidinostat group) and 121 to placebo plus exemestane group (placebo group). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. The median follow-up from randomization to data cut-off (February 25, 2021) of this analysis was 26.5 months (range, 13.9-45.5 months). A total of 231 deaths (63.3%) from 365 patients occurred, including 155 deaths (63.5%) in the tucidinostat group and 76 deaths (62.8%) in the placebo group. The median OS was 30.3 months (95% CI, 26.7-36.7) in the tucidinostat group and 30.3 months (95% CI, 24.8-38.1) in the placebo group. The safety profiles of both tucidinostat and placebo groups remained consistent with those previously reported, and no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. Neutropenia of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 51.6% of the patients in the tucidinostat group and 2.5% of the patients in the placebo group. Adverse events (AEs) that led to treatment discontinuations from any cause occurred in 28 (11.5%) patients in the tucidinostat group and 4 (3.3%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Although tucidinostat in combination with exemestane had produced a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint PFS, the ACE study did not show a prolongation of the secondary endpoint OS in the tucidinostat combination regimen. Ongoing studies have been considered in terms of potential identification of what patient subpopulations could benefit most from the tucidinostat combination regimens in advanced HR(+) breast cancer.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor to invasive breast cancer. However, if left untreated, about 50% of DCIS progress. Preventing such a progression is of paramount importance. Cumulative evidence indicated that the mevalonate cascade, the core of cholesterol biosynthesis, contributes to the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway providing the isoprenoids required for GTPase activation, the nuclear accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) coactivator, and the subsequent gene transcription and that the disruption of this cooperation associated with tumor progression. METHODS: In this in silico study, we investigated whether such a disruption occurred already during the transformation of the normal mammary epithelium into DCIS. To this aim, we interrogated a publicly available dataset, and we explored the interrelationship of the genes involved in the de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and the association with those coding for the core components of the Hippo signaling pathway in a set of patient-matched samples of DCIS and corresponding histologically normal (HN) epithelium. RESULTS: Most genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were more expressed in DCIS than in the corresponding HN epithelium. This differential expression was associated with a substantial change in their correlation profile. In particular, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR) and INSIG1 lost the positive association shown in the HN epithelium, and their negative association with LSS switched to a positive one. Also, GGPS1, which plays a crucial role in isoprenoids production, significantly changed its correlation profile. The positive association between GGPS1 and HMGCR or INSIG1 disappeared, whereas the positive association with SQLE, which drives the irreversible commitment to cholesterol, switched to a negative one in DCIS. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings corroborated the hypothesis that a dysfunctional mevalonate pathway possibly concurs with DCIS development by leading to abnormal production of isoprenoids, which in turn activate GTPases and promote YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation, and suggested the safe and low-cost treatment with statins as the possible winning strategy to contrast this metabolic dysfunction.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: We report a case of metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive breast cancer who achieved encouraging clinical benefits across multiple pyrotinib-based anti-HER2 therapies. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old woman was diagnosed with hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-positive breast cancer in June 2018, and did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or anti-HER2 targeted therapy post-breast conserving surgery. By May 2020, she developed recurrence of the left breast mass with metastases in liver, bone and lymph nodes. She then received pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy. Both the left breast mass and liver metastases showed noticeable improvement, with the disease evaluated as partial response (PR). Despite this promising result, the patient developed brain metastases after first-line treatment. A combination regimen of pyrotinib retention plus inetetamab and vinorelbine were administered as second-line anti-HER2 therapy, and the brain metastases visibly shrunk, leading to PR, with the extracranial lesions remaining stable. Ultimately, due to brain lesions progression, the treatment was transitioned to trastuzumab deruxtecan. We applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to illustrate the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) to detect the disease status. CONCLUSIONS: Pyrotinib is a promising antineoplastic agent for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients. Under the guidance of precision medicine, it is encouraged to utilize novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods to manage advanced breast cancer patients.",

These technologies are based on specific probe labeling systems for the detection of tissue components [proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA)], as well as on detailed image analysis, combined with computational tools. We are synthetically presenting technologies based on image analysis, such as multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), as well as the ones not based on image analysis, such as multiplex in situ hybridizations (ISHs) using various principles. All of them are supported by powerful software which enable both tissue segmentation and data analysis. In the context of cancer treatment personalization, these technologies can reveal areas of tumor tissue and/or cellular subpopulations that are responsible for good or bad responses to anticancer drugs. Thus, they represent an unprecedented aid in the exploration of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which has already been shown to be one of the main reasons for the therapeutic failure of targeted anticancer treatments. The arrival of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and radio-immunoconjugates (RICs) in the therapeutic arsenal in oncology imposes a deep exploration of molecular ITH, where technologies of spatial tissue analysis reveal an emerging category of biomarkers-spatial biomarkers.",

Prior to this, the patient underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgery as well as adjuvant endocrine therapy. We present and discuss three important treatment decision nodes associated with it. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast (cT4bN2M0, stage IIIB, Luminal B HER2-negative type) at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University in 2020, and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and modified radical mastectomy of the left breast from 2020 to 2021. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed in the left chest wall and left upper and lower clavicular region. Adjuvant therapy is anastrozole endocrine therapy. Multiple liver metastases developed in 2022. The pathological molecular typing of liver metastases was confirmed to be consistent with the primary lesion. In the context of primary endocrine resistance, the first-line treatment of choice was fulvestrant in combination with a targeted CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib). This combination regimen made the liver metastases visibly shrunk, leading to partial response (PR) and has achieved a progression-free survival of 12 months. And there were no serious drug-related adverse events during first-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CDK4/6 inhibitor is a promising antineoplastic agent for HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer patients. With the development of research, the application scope of CDK4/6 inhibitors is gradually expanding, and the precision treatment of breast cancer requires more rational drug selection and combination.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors comprising less than 1% of cases, categorized as benign, borderline, or malignant. Treatment typically involves complete surgical excision with wide margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be recommended for borderline or malignant tumors, or when clear margins cannot be achieved through surgery alone. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 14 women diagnosed with phyllodes tumors between 2015 and 2023. Among them, 36% had benign tumors and 64% had borderline/malignant tumors. The majority (86%) underwent breast-conserving surgery. Postoperative radiation therapy was delivered to the whole breast/chest wall, with a median biologically effective dose (BED) of 92.7 Gy (90.0-102.6 Gy), representing a moderate dose-escalation over conventional breast cancer schedules. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 48.5 months, no local or distant recurrence were observed. Mild to moderate skin toxicity occurred in all patients: 36% reported grade 1, 43% grade 2, and 21% grade 3 toxicity. One patient developed grade 2 fibrosis during follow-up. No significant correlations were found between the severity of acute/late toxicity and tumor size, surgical approach, or the radiation field's planning target volume (PTV). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation therapy appears to be well tolerated and feasible for high-risk phyllodes tumors. However, the decision to utilize radiotherapy should be personalized, considering tumor characteristics and the risks and benefits associated with treatment.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, responsible for a large number of deaths, especially among women. Therapeutic options for breast cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy, but further studies of the pathogenesis of this disease and new treatments are still needed. In vitro and in vivo cancer models are important research tools. Murine Ehrlich tumors are one of these models, especially for hormone-positive breast cancer. The present narrative review discusses characteristics of the Ehrlich tumor model, laboratory manipulations of Ehrlich cells (ECs), and applications in pharmacological, pathological, and translational studies. METHODS: This review was based on scientific articles, books, and theses on Ehrlich tumors. We searched the PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar, Google, and Clarivate databases. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Hormone-positive ECs produce solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC) and ascitic Ehrlich carcinoma (AEC), with different features and applications. The presence of SEC or AEC induces systemic and immunological alterations that are similar to cancer in humans, what makes this model applicable to different studies in the cancer field. CONCLUSIONS: Ehrlich tumors are a relevant tool for improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer and investigating the tumor microenvironment, side effects of therapies, and new treatment options. Despite some limitations, such as the absence of an invasive phenotype to produce metastasis, both SEC and AEC are relevant in preclinical and translational studies of breast cancer.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the field of breast cancer diagnosis and therapy has witnessed rapid technological advances. Concurrently, the emergence of molecular biology and novel detection methodologies has facilitated the transition of breast cancer management into the precision medicine era. The primary objective of this review is to discuss the transformation in the research and development paradigm for breast cancer therapies and strategies. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for relevant studies published over the past 20 years using keywords including \"breast cancer\", \"clinical trial\", \"seamless\", \"master protocol\", \"umbrella\", \"basket\", \"platform\", and \"precision medicine\". Articles were screened for eligibility and key data extracted. The search was limited to English-language publications. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The review identifies three core innovations in breast cancer trial methodology: (I) in terms of research speed, the traditional three-stage drug development models are being substituted by \"seamless designs\" as exemplified by the immunotherapy combination study NCT0328056. (II) Addressing research breadth, \"master protocols\" such as basket trials (IMMU-132-01), umbrella trials (FUTURE), and platform trials (I-SPY 2) have been introduced, allowing the simultaneous assessment of multiple treatments or disease subtypes within a singular framework. (III) Pertaining to research precision, newer designs utilize biomarkers such as \"enrichment\" (seen in EMBRACA and OlympiA trials) and \"marker stratification\" (as in the SOLAR-1 trial), enabling the identification of appropriate patient subgroups and the provision of tailored therapy strategies, a stark contrast to traditional histopathology-based evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trial design in breast cancer research has been revolutionized, moving towards more efficient and targeted strategies. Despite the presence of ethical, logistical, and data complexities, it is anticipated that ongoing technological and regulatory enhancements will pave the way for even more refined research approaches, subsequently influencing future research, clinical practices, and policymaking in breast cancer care.",

        "AB": "Breast cancer is a disease of global concern, regardless of economic status. A significant disparity in breast cancer care between low- and high-income countries is not unexpected, but consideration can be given to particular aspects of therapy to allow as much equitability as possible. One of these aspects involves biopsy of breast lesions. With available resources, management in developed countries focuses on dealing with screening and image-detected lesions. In such circumstances, advanced percutaneous biopsy techniques are utilized liberally. However, where resources are less forthcoming for mammographic screening, women frequently present with symptomatic, palpable and larger tumours. This scenario behooves the clinician to modify treatment approaches and yet use cost-effective management strategies. It is essential that thought is applied to breast biopsy technique used where there is cost-consciousness as it significantly influences subsequent therapy. Less expensive strategies like fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB), when performed with particular attention to technique, handling, transportation and preparation of biopsy specimens allows a high level of accuracy and provides adequate information for the next steps in treatment. This mini-review discusses the variation in biopsy approaches among lower and higher income areas and offers suggestions for appropriate breast biopsy strategies in resource-limited countries.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous, presenting challenges in prognostic assessment. Developing a universally applicable prognostic model could simplify clinical decision-making. This study aims to develop and validate a novel breast cancer prognosis model using coagulation-related genes with broad clinical applicability. METHODS: A total of 203 genes related to coagulation were obtained from the KEGG database, and the mRNA data of 1,099 tumor tissue samples and 572 samples of normal tissue were retrieved from the TCGA-BRCA cohort and GTEx databases. The R package \"limma\" was utilized to detect variations in gene expression related to coagulation between the malignancies and normal tissue. A model was constructed in the TCGA cohort through a multivariable Cox regression analysis, followed by validation using the GSE42568 dataset as the testing set. Constructing a nomogram incorporating clinical factors to enhance the predictive capacity of the model. Utilizing the ESTIMATE algorithm to investigate the immune infiltration levels in groups with deferent risk. Performing drug sensitivity analysis using the \"oncoPredict\" package. RESULTS: A risk model consisting of six coagulation-associated genes (SERPINA1, SERPINF2, C1S, CFB, RASGRP1, and TLN2) was created and successfully tested for validation. Identified were 6 genes that serve as protective factors in the model's development. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a worse prognosis in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. The ROC analysis showed that the model accurately forecasted the overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients at 1, 3, and 5 years. Nomogram accompanied by calibration curves can also provide better guidance for clinical decision-making. The low-risk group is more likely to respond well to immunotherapy, whereas the high-risk group may show improved responses to Gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, individuals in distinct risk categories displayed different responses to various medications within the identical therapeutic category. CONCLUSION: We established a breast cancer prognostic model incorporating six coagulation-associated genes and explored its clinical utility. This model offers valuable insights for clinical decision-making and drug selection in breast cancer patients, contributing to personalized and precise treatment advancements.",

        "AB": "With the continuous improvement of systemic treatment, reasonable local regional control of early-stage breast cancer can be translated into survival benefits. The optimization of regional nodal management in patients with limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis needs to be weighed by surgical complications, regional recurrence risk, and lymph node status, as well as other escalating treatment (systemic/radiotherapy) that may result from de-escalating surgery. With the effective support and supplementation of systemic therapy and radiotherapy, the management of axillary surgery is developing in a de-escalating trend. The widespread application of neoadjuvant therapy has contributed to optimizing the management of patients with clinically node-negative/imaging node-positive disease. In clinical practice, it is necessary to consider the residual tumor burden of regional lymph nodes when formulating the optimal irradiation fields in patients with limited positive SLN without axillary lymph node dissection. The combined application of genomic tests and American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011/AMAROS criteria could provide patients with a better strategy of dual de-escalation treatment, which includes the de-escalation of both axillary surgery and systemic treatment. In the era of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the regional nodal management of breast cancer should adhere to the concept of \"updating ideas, making bold assumptions, and carefully seeking proof\", make full use of the benefits of systemic therapy and radiotherapy to reduce the scope of surgery and complications, and expand the \"net benefit\" of efficacy and quality of life. This review discusses the optimization of regional nodal management in the era of SLNB, in order to provide reference information for clinicians.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Primary resistance to trastuzumab frequently occurs in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive (+) breast cancer patients and remains a clinical challenge. Pyrotinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown efficacy in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. However, the efficacy of pyrotinib in HER2+ breast cancer with primary trastuzumab resistance is unknown. METHODS: HER2+ breast cancer cells sensitive or primarily resistant to trastuzumab were treated with trastuzumab, pyrotinib, or the combination. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and HER2 downstream signal pathways were analyzed. The effects of pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus trastuzumab were compared in breast cancer cells in vitro and a xenograft mouse model with primary resistance to trastuzumab. RESULTS: Pyrotinib had a therapeutic effect on trastuzumab-sensitive HER2+ breast cancer cells by inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and rat sarcoma virus (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. In primary trastuzumab-resistant cells, pyrotinib inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion, and HER2 downstream pathways, whereas trastuzumab had no effects. The combination with trastuzumab did not show increased effects compared with pyrotinib alone. Compared with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, pyrotinib plus trastuzumab was more effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and HER2 downstream pathways in breast cancer cells and tumor growth in a trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Pyrotinib-containing treatments exhibited anti-cancer effects in HER2+ breast cancer cells sensitive and with primary resistance to trastuzumab. Notably, pyrotinib plus trastuzumab was more effective than trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in inhibiting tumor growth and HER2 downstream pathways in HER2+ breast cancer with primary resistance to trastuzumab. These findings support clinical testing of the therapeutic efficacy of dual anti-HER2 treatment combining an intracellular small molecule with an extracellular antibody.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), phyllodes tumor is classified into three categories: benign, borderline, and malignant. The treatment of phyllodes tumor is wide focal excision combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in certain cases. Herein, we report a 47-year-old female who presented with a giant borderline mass approximately 19.5 x 16.9 x 9.3 cm in size. From medical history, we noticed that the mass begun to develop during puberty. Wide focal excision of the tumor and immediate implant-based reconstruction with free nipple graft was performed, with the tumor specimen measuring 16.5 x 14.2 x 8.7 cm. Histological examination reported a borderline phyllodes tumor, and in this case, the patient did not undergo adjuvant treatment.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: For preference sensitive treatments, such as breast reconstructions, there are barriers to conducting randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary aims of this systematic review were to investigate what type of research questions are explored by RCTs in breast reconstruction, where have they been performed and where have they been published, and to thematise the research questions and thus create an overview of the state of the research field. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials investigating any aspect of breast reconstructions were included. The PubMed database was searched with a pre-defined search string. Inclusion and data abstraction was performed in a pre-defined standardised fashion. For the purpose of this study, we defined key issues as comparison of categories of breast reconstruction and comparison of immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, when the thematisation was done. RESULTS: A total of 419 abstracts were retrieved from the search. Of the 419, 310 were excluded as they were not RCTs concerning some aspect of breast reconstruction, which left us with 110 abstracts to be included in the study. The research questions of the included studies could more or less be divided into seven different themes inclusive of 2 key issues: Other issues - comparison of different categories of breast reconstruction, comparison of immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, surgical details within a category of breast reconstruction, surgical details valid for several categories of breast reconstruction, donor site management, anaesthetics, and non-surgical details. Only five studies compared key issues, and they all illustrate the challenges with RCTs in breast reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 110 publications based on RCTs in breast reconstruction have been published. Seven themes of research questions could be identified. Only five studies have explored the key issues. Better scientific evidence is needed for the key issues in breast reconstruction, for example by implementing a new study design in the field.",

        "AB": "HER3 is mutated in ~2%-10% of cancers depending on the cancer type. We found the HER3-V104L mutation to be activating from patient-derived mutations introduced via lentiviral transduction in HER3KO HER2 + HCC1569 breast cancer cells in which endogenous HER3 was eliminated by CRISPR/Cas9. Cells expressing HER3-V104L showed higher p-HER3 and p-ERK1/2 expression versus cells expressing wild-type HER3 or HER3-V104M. Patients whose tumor expressed the HER3 V104L variant had a reduced probability of overall survival compared to patients lacking a HER3 mutation whereas we did not find a statistically significant difference in overall survival of various cancer patients with the HER3 V104M mutation. Our data showed that HER2 inhibitors suppressed cell growth of HCC1569HER3KO cells stably expressing the HER3-V104L mutation. Cancer cell lines (SNU407, UC15 and DV90) with endogenous HER3-V104M mutation showed reduced cell proliferation and p-HER2/p-ERK1/2 expression with HER2 inhibitor treatment. Knock down of HER3 abrogated cell proliferation in the above cell lines which were overall more sensitive to the ERK inhibitor SCH779284 versus PI3K inhibitors. HER3-V104L mutation stabilized HER3 protein expression in COS7 and SNUC5 cells. COS7 cells transiently transfected with the HER3-V104L mutation in the presence of HER binding partners showed higher expression of p-HER3, p-ERK1/2 versus HER3-WT in a NRG-independent manner without any change in AKT signaling. Overall, this study shows the clinical relevance of the HER3 V104L and the V104M mutations and its response to HER2, PI3K and ERK inhibitors.",
