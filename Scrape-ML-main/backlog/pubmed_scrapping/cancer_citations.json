Participants reported on average four modifiable risk factors: most commonly chronic pain (79.1%), obesity (57.3%), and frailty (40.9%). Most participants (80.4%) reviewed all resources provided and reported action/intention to address issues identified (90.9%). Participants perceived MPP as acceptable (3.2/5), appropriate (3.3/5), and feasible (3.4/5). Early trends for participants progressing to surgery (\nn\n = 33) show a reduced length of stay (MPP = 4.3, baseline = 5.3 days).\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      MPP demonstrated high adoption, fidelity, and participant engagement. It is acceptable, appropriate and feasible and has the potential to be scaled-up digitally at low-cost. Modifiable risk factors were prevalent and early indications suggest this preoperative intervention may benefit both patients and the healthcare system."

Furthermore, while STR testing is critical for identifying graft failure/rejection within the first year posttransplant, FCI appears superior to STR at detecting late relapses with low-level disease. Therefore, STR testing from patients 1 year or more post-HSCT may be unnecessary, as BM biopsy evaluation is sufficient to identify disease relapse."

This pilot study tested messages communicating oral HPV and oropharyngeal cancer risk among a sample of U.S. young adult men (aged 18-26). Six oral HPV and cancer risk messages were tested in an online survey. Participants (\nN\n = 68) were randomly assigned to one of two message sets, each containing three unique text-based messages. Participants evaluated messages separately based on various measures (e.g., perceived message effectiveness [PME], novelty). One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess evaluation differences within message sets. Participants provided open-ended feedback about each message, which were synthesized into overarching themes. Participants were receptive to the risk messages, rating them high on PME (mean range = 3.72-4.25 out of 5) and other measures. Analyses identified three high-performing messages. For example, participants rated a message about HPV-linked oropharyngeal cancer risk rates in men versus women higher on attention and novelty than two other messages in the same set (both \np\ns < .05). Participants were shown three messages (instead of all six) in each message set to minimize survey fatigue. Common themes from open-ended feedback were that participants liked the short-form structure of the messages and that the messages used gender-tailored language. In conclusion, oral HPV and oropharyngeal cancer risk messages may be useful for increasing risk awareness among men in the U.S. Further work should test such messages in rigorous experimental contexts to assess their efficacy in modifying other health outcomes, such as HPV vaccination behaviors."

The defects in primary cilium have profound effects on the developmental program, including the maturation of retinal epithelium. The ciliary length is tightly regulated during ciliogenesis, but the impact of inflammation on ciliary length remains elusive. The current study investigates the outcome of inflammatory stimuli for the primary cilium length in retinal epithelium cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here, we report that exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha elongates cilia in a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK)-dependent manner. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial LPS and interferon-gamma have similar effects on ciliary length. In contrast, febrile condition-mimicking heat stress dramatically reduced the number of ciliated cells regardless of TNF-alpha exposure but did not shorten TNF-induced elongation, suggesting distinct but rapid effects of inflammatory stresses on ciliogenesis."

This case highlights the importance of early surgical consultation and tissue biopsy to correctly diagnose the etiology of severely painful mastitis and prevent prolonged symptomology and repeated administrations of ineffective treatments. Diffuse dermal angiomatosis should be considered when suspected breast cellulitis is refractory to treatment or there is concern for inflammatory breast cancer, especially in pendulous-breasted women with comorbidities that increase susceptibility to local tissue hypoxia."

Therefore, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was proposed to remove the duodenal lesion. Unfortunately, satisfactory visualization of the duodenal lesion was not obtained during gastroscopic operation. Unexpectedly, duodenoscopy provided optimal visualization of the duodenal lesion. Consequently, the \"sandwich method\" using duodenoscopy-gastroscopy-duodenoscopy was successfully performed to remove the challenging duodenal lesion. Firstly, the duodenoscopy was used to create a submucosal bleb through injecting saline containing 0.3 % indigo carmine. Subsequently, the gastroscopy with a transparent capwas used to remove the duodenal lesion with en bloc resection. Then, the duodenoscopy was reused to close the mucosal defect. Finally, pathologic examination showed a tubule-villous adenoma. The patient was recovered uneventfully, and discharged 2 days later."

However, due to the decreasing trend of this disease over the last few decades, gastric cancer ranks seventh and eighth in Spanish women and men, respectively, as a cancer-related cause of death, while being the fourth most frequent digestive cancer, after colorectal, pancreatic and liver cancer. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer mortality figures have been continually increasing, and nowadays this malignancy ranks second among digestive cancers in terms of mortality in both sexes. The distinct trends of stomach and pancreatic cancer mortality rates might be explained by changes in exposure to risk factors, mainly to H. pylori eradication. Notably, these tumors share several modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco consumption, obesity, and physical inactivity. Since these risk factors are also associated with many other cancers, effective cancer prevention strategies are needed to reduce the risk of developing cancer in the population."

Thirty-nine patients received treosulfan pharmacokinetic assessment to evaluate cumulative AUC, with five infants receiving real-time assessment to facilitate daily dose adjustment. OS, DFS, and EFS were 87%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. Median follow-up was 32.1 months (range 0.82-160 months) following transplant. Lower EFS was associated with patient age (<1 year; p = .057) and lower cumulative treosulfan dose (<42 g/m\n2\n; p = .003). Stable donor chimerism in B-cell, NK-cell, and granulocyte lineages at 1-year post-transplant were more prevalent in patients receiving thiotepa conditioning. Two infants required daily dose adjustment to treosulfan to avoid high AUC.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      Excellent clinical outcomes and stable chimerism were observed in this patient series.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods were used to detect the serum HBV marker HBsAg.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      A total of 603,082 individuals were enrolled, and serum samples were collected for analysis from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2023. The prevalence of HBsAg positive in the study population was 5.23% (31,528/603,082). The prevalence of HBsAg positive was greater in males than in females (5.60% [17,660/315,183] vs. 4.82% [13,868/287,899], \u03c72 = 187.52, P <0.0001). The elderly participants exhibited a greater prevalence of HBV infection than younger participants (\u03c72 = 41.73, P <0.0001). Birth cohort analysis revealed an overall downward trend in HBV prevalence for both males and females. Individuals born in more recent cohorts exhibited a lower prevalence of HBV infection as compared to those born earlier.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      The current prevalence of HBV infection remains above 5% in populations eligible for HCC screening in China. Further efforts should be made to increase the accessibility of HCC screening among individuals with HBV infection."

It is recognized that folate receptors are gradually overexpressed in the cellular membrane with the progress of cancer from stage 1 to stage 4. Utilizing the fact, herein, developed a porous silica nanoparticle system C1@SiO\n2\n-FA-NP; A) impregnated with thermodynamically stable Mn(II) complex (1) molecules within the core of the nanoparticle, and B) surface functionalized with folate units. It exhibited a high longitudinal relaxivity value r\n1\n = 21.45 mM\n-1\ns\n-1\n that substantially increased to r\n1\n = 40.97 mM\n-1\ns\n-1\n in the presence of 0.67 mM concentration of BSA under the physiological condition. The in vitro fluorescent images after surface conjugation of C1@SiO\n2\n-FA-NP with FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) buttressed the inclusion of the nanoparticle exclusively within the cancerous HeLa cells than that of healthy HEK293 cells. The importance of the surface-bound folate unit in the nanoparticle is further established by comparing the fluorescent images of HeLa cells in the absence of the group. Finally, the applicability of C1@SiO\n2\n-FA-NP as the T\n1\n-weighted MRI contrast agent for early-stage cancer diagnosis is established within C57BL/6 mice after infecting the mice with HeLa cells."

All lesions enhanced and were successfully sampled followed by marker clip insertion. Most biopsies (87.5%) were performed with the breast in cranio-caudal compression using a horizontal approach. Procedural duration ranged from 13 to 33 min (mean 22 min). Radiation dose was similar to standard stereotactic biopsy. Post-biopsy hematomas occurred in three patients, none required intervention. Clip displacement occurred in three cases. Core biopsy histopathology results were benign (n = 8), malignant (n = 7) and a borderline breast lesion (BBL) (n = 1). Patient satisfaction rates were high. Imaging follow-up is ongoing.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      CEMBx is a quick, safe and reliable alternative to MRIBx to sample COLs."

Recently, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) approaches have demonstrated significant improvements to depth and missingness in proteome data, but traditional TPP (a.k.a. CEllular Thermal Shift Assay \"CETSA\") workflows typically employ multiplexing reagents reliant on data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Herein, we introduce a new experimental design for the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration via label-free DIA approach (PISA-DIA). We highlight the proteome coverage and sensitivity achieved by using multiple overlapping thermal gradients alongside DIA-MS, which maximizes efficiencies in PISA sample concatenation and safeguards against missing protein targets that exist at high melting temperatures. We demonstrate our extended PISA-DIA design has superior proteome coverage as compared to using tandem-mass tags (TMT) necessitating DDA-MS analysis. Importantly, we demonstrate our PISA-DIA approach has the quantitative and statistical rigor using A-1331852, a specific inhibitor of BCL-xL. Due to the high melt temperature of this protein target, we utilized our extended multiple gradient PISA-DIA workflow to identify BCL-xL. We assert our novel overlapping gradient PISA-DIA-MS approach is ideal for unbiased drug target deconvolution, spanning a large temperature range whilst minimizing target dropout between gradients, increasing the likelihood of resolving the protein targets of novel compounds."

Markov models are powerful tools to capture this stochasticity and render effective treatment decisions. This paper provides an overview of the Markov models for clinical decision analysis in radiation oncology. A comprehensive literature search was conducted within MEDLINE using PubMed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only studies published from 2000 to 2023 were considered. Selected publications were summarized in two categories: (i) studies that compare two (or more) fixed treatment policies using Monte Carlo simulation and (ii) studies that seek an optimal treatment policy through Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Relevant to the scope of this study, 61 publications were selected for detailed review. The majority of these publications (n = 56) focused on comparative analysis of two or more fixed treatment policies using Monte Carlo simulation. Classifications based on cancer site, utility measures and the type of sensitivity analysis are presented. Five publications considered MDPs with the aim of computing an optimal treatment policy; a detailed statement of the analysis and results is provided for each work. As an extension of Markov model-based simulation analysis, MDP offers a flexible framework to identify an optimal treatment policy among a possibly large set of treatment policies. However, the applications of MDPs to oncological decision-making have been understudied, and the full capacity of this framework to render complex optimal treatment decisions warrants further consideration."

The significant morphologic overlap with other types of renal neoplasia and the limited availability of FH and 2-succinylcholine immunostains for diagnostic use outside large referral centers have created numerous diagnostic pitfalls. As FH-deficient RCC can be associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome, the importance of an accurate diagnosis goes beyond the prognosis and treatment of an individual patient. We present 2 patients with FH-deficient RCC showing a peculiar pattern of GATA3 immunoexpression restricted to tumor nucleoli. If confirmed in further larger studies, this could provide an additional diagnostic clue for considering the FH-deficient RCC diagnosis, and given the frequent papillary morphology and possible hilar location can lead to the misdiagnosis as high-grade urothelial carcinoma, and is an important diagnostic pitfall to be aware of."

We still do not understand all the details of carcinogenesis, and effective treatment is lacking for many oncological diseases. Animal models provide an irreplaceable tool to observe the growth and spreading of neoplastic cells in an environment of living organisms, to test the efficacy of cancer treatment, side effects, and toxicity, and to study the tumor microenvironment. Mice are the most often used model organisms because of their easy handling, short reproductive period, multiple strains, and complete DNA sequencing. An ideal model should accurately recapitulate each step of tumor development. Recent techniques have established models that enable the study of different aspects of cancer, but choosing a particular model depends on the application of output data. This article aimed to review induced, transplantable, and engineered mice and highlight their significance for recent and future cancer research."

        "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health concern because it increases the risk of several diseases, including cancer. Crosstalk between obesity and cancer seems to be very complex, and the interaction between adipocytes and cancer cells leads to changes in adipocytes' function and their paracrine signaling, promoting a microenvironment that supports tumor growth. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a tumor-associated enzyme that not only participates in pH regulation but also facilitates metabolic reprogramming and supports the migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. In addition, CA IX expression, predominantly regulated via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), serves as a surrogate marker of hypoxia. In this study, we investigated the impact of adipocytes and adipocyte-derived factors on the expression of CA IX in colon and breast cancer cells. We observed increased expression of CA9 mRNA as well as CA IX protein in the presence of adipocytes and adipocyte-derived conditioned medium. Moreover, we confirmed that adipocytes affect the hypoxia signaling pathway and that the increased CA IX expression results from adipocyte-mediated induction of HIF-1\u03b1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that adipocyte-mediated upregulation of CA IX leads to increased migration and decreased adhesion of colon cancer cells. Finally, we brought experimental evidence that adipocytes, and more specifically leptin, upregulate CA IX expression in cancer cells and consequently promote tumor progression."

The therapy strategy is important in skin cancer treatment, depending on several criteria such as stage, size, and localization. Removal of cancerous tissue following anticancer therapeutic administration is considered as gold standard in skin cancer treatment. However, annually rising drug resistance, local inflammation, and ineffective treatment result in a reduction in the effectiveness of the patient's treatment. Nanotechnology has emerged as a prospective in the field of skin cancer medicine, offering innovative, promising solutions for therapeutic procedures and targeted drug delivery. Different nanomaterials are investigated for their potential in skin cancer treatment. Nanohydrogels as a hybrid material, have gained considerable attention due to their unique biomedical and pharmaceutical properties, such as biocompatibility, high water content, and tunable physicochemical characteristics. The principal problem with common skin melanoma chemotherapy is the strong side effects because therapeutics used for treatment do not distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells. Nanohydrogels, as a new-generation, versatile system with the possession of dual characteristics of hydrogels and nanoparticles have shown great potential in targeted delivery in cancer therapy thanks to the possibility of their various modifications, and by that overcome problems with side effects of treatment. This scientific review provides an analysis of the current state of research on nanohydrogels in skin cancer medicine, highlighting their design principles, synthesis methods, and applications in drug delivery, imaging, and combination therapies."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted from tumors and cancer-associated fibroblasts, are involved in the metastatic process mediating their organotropism through their involvement in the pre-metastatic niche formation. We have been developing suicide gene therapy mediated by EVs secreted from mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells, tumor cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Suicide gene EVs conjugated with prodrug are tumor tropic, penetrate tumor cells, and kill them by intracellular conversion of nontoxic prodrug to an efficient anti-cancer drug. Here, we discuss findings regarding the possibility of using suicide gene EVs as a novel therapeutic approach for metastases, via pre-metastatic niche modification. The suicide gene EVs provide a future perspective for metastasis prevention."

The methodology of CNV detection has revolutionized in past decades, and current high throughput technologies enable us to analyze the entire spectrum of CNV alterations at the whole genome scale. Thus, identifying novel CNV biomarkers and evaluating their applicability in biomedicine are becoming increasingly important. The aim of this review was to summarize copy number changes occurring in malignant melanomas. We made an overview of specific genes and chromosomal locations affected in sporadic and familial melanoma and also of known germline alterations in melanoma-prone families. We summarized genomic regions aberrant in malignant melanoma and highlighted those frequently discussed in the literature, suggesting 7q, 11q, 12q, 9p, and 1q, but also others, as the most affected ones."

In this study, CALR and EIF2AK2 expression was measured in the clinical specimens of 39 patients with melanoma. Then, we constructed knockdown and overexpression cell models of CALR and EIF2AK2 and used wound healing and Transwell assays to observe cell migration and invasion. Apoptosis, EDU, and ROS assays were used to measure cell apoptosis and proliferation, as well as ROS levels. The effect of CALR on endoplasmic reticulum stress was detected using endoplasmic reticulum fluorescent probes. Western blotting was used to detect protein levels of CALR, EIF2AK2, ADAR1, and MMP14. The results indicated that CALR and EIF2AK2 expression levels were significantly higher in human melanoma tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissue. In addition, we found a correlation between CALR and the expression of EIF2AK2 and MMP14, and the experimental results indicated that overexpression of CALR significantly upregulated the expression of EIF2AK2, MMP14, and ADAR1, while knockdown of CALR inhibited their expression. Notably, the knockdown of EIF2AK2 in the CALR overexpression group blocked the upregulation of MMP14 and ADAR1 expression by CALR, and the knockdown of both CALR and EIF2AK2 significantly inhibited MMP14 and ADAR1 expression. In conclusion, CALR and EIF2AK2 play a promoting role in melanoma progression, and knockdown of CALR and EIF2AK2 may be an effective anti-tumor target, and its mechanism may be through MMP14, ADAR1 signaling."

In the last few years, attention has been focused on substances of natural origin with anticancer activity. One such substance is thymol and its derivatives, which have been shown to have an antitumor effect also against CRC cells. In our study, we focused on determining the biological and antibacterial effects of thymol and thymol derivatives. Analyses were performed on a 3D model of human colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT-116 and HT-29) - spheroids. The cytotoxic (MTT assay) and genotoxic effect (comet assay) of thymol and derivatives: acetic acid thymol ester and thymol \u00df-D-glucoside were determined. ROS levels (ROS-Glo\u2122 H2O2 Assay) and total antioxidant status (Randox TAS Assay) were also monitored. Last but not least, we also detected the effect of the derivatives using a disk diffusion assay and determined the number of colonies on the plates on selected bacteria such as Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus and Weizmannia coagulans. The derivatives did not show a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of LAB bacteria (lactic acid bacteria) in contrast to thymol. Overall, thymol derivatives are cytotoxic, genotoxic and increase ROS levels. Among the derivatives tested, acetic acid thymol ester (IC50 ~ 0.2 \u03bcg/ml) was more effective. The second derivative tested (thymol \u03b2-D-glucoside) was effective at higher concentrations than thymol. Our research confirmed that thymol derivatives have a toxic effect on the 3D model of intestinal tumor cells, while they do not have a toxic effect on selected intestinal bacteria. Thus, they could bring new significance to the prevention or treatment of CRC."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer, is a molecularly heterogeneous disease with intratumoral heterogeneity and a significant mutational burden associated with clinical outcome. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of primary de novo lung cancer and significantly influences the response of tumor cells to therapy. Hypoxia, an integral part of the tumor microenvironment and a serious clinical phenomenon, is associated with increased genetic instability and a more aggressive phenotype of NSCLC, which correlates with the risk of metastasis. Low oxygen concentration influences all components of TME including the immune microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible pathway activated in response to low oxygen supply mediates the expression of genes important for the adaptation of tumor cells to microenvironmental changes. A highly active transmembrane hypoxia-induced metalloenzyme - carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), as a part of transport metabolon, contributes to the maintenance of intracellular pH within physiological values and to the acidification of the extracellular space. CAIX supports cell migration and invasion and plays an important role in NSCLC tumor tissue and pleural effusion. Due to its high expression, it also represents a potential diagnostic differential biomarker and therapeutic target in NSCLC. To test new potential targeted therapeutic compounds, suitable models are required that more faithfully simulate tumor tissue, TME components, and spatial architecture."

Patients ineligible for chemotherapy (66 of 291, 22.7%) due to poor general condition or co-morbidities were not included in the study. The median overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.7-12.0). Of the 225 patients who received first-line therapy, 47.6%, 16.9%, and 3.1% received second-, third-, and fourth-line therapy, respectively. Survival correlated significantly with the number of treatment lines received (p<0.001), with a median OS from diagnosis of 7.8 (95% CI 6.6-9.4), 12.0 (95% CI 10.0-14.0), and 20.0 months (95% CI 18.0-23.0) for patients receiving 1, 2, and \u22653 lines of treatment, respectively. This study confirmed the positive impact of the number of chemotherapy lines on OS. This highlights the importance of the ratio of patients receiving multiple lines of therapy as well as the availability of new and effective drugs in real-life clinical practice. The selection of optimal therapy for each patient in the first-line therapy is important because a significant number of patients do not receive second-line therapy."

The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway is activated when oxygen levels decline, influencing cell activities and promoting tumor progression. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are the main targets for therapeutic intervention in tumors. Nevertheless, the significance of HIF-2\u03b1 is often overlooked. This review examines the physiological role of HIF-2\u03b1 in tumor growth and its involvement in tumor growth. HIFs, composed of hypoxia-responsive \u03b1 and oxygeninsensitive \u03b2 subunits, play a crucial role in controlling gene expression in both normal and solid tumor tissues under low oxygen levels. HIF-3\u03b1, formerly considered a detrimental modulator of HIF-regulated genes, exerts a transcriptional regulatory role by inhibiting gene expression through competition with HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 for binding to transcriptional sites in target genes under hypoxia. Recent research indicates that various HIF-3 variants exhibit distinct and potentially contrasting functionalities. Hypoxia often occurs during the initiation and progression of cancer formation. Recent research has discovered that HIF-2\u03b1, also known as endothelial PAS domain protein 1, has a significant impact on tumors. HIF-2\u03b1 is a significant cancer-causing gene and a crucial predictor of prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. However, due to limited research investigating the relationship between HIF-2\u03b1 and small-cell lung cancer, it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion. HIF-2\u03b1 plays a vital function in cancer by preserving the stemness of cancer cells. This review provides a comprehensive overview of HIF-2 and the role of HIF-3 in various cancer-related processes, as well as its potential as a targeted therapeutic approach."

        "abstract": "Background:\n        \n\n      \n      Recently, the number of patients who manifest intestinal disorders has increased. Particularly, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients, which include Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), are on the rise, especially in the young generation. Behcet's disease (an autoimmune disease) and bowel obstruction are also common intestinal disorders. Furthermore, colorectal cancer, including colon and rectum cancer and small intestinal cancer, are the typical disorders in the intestine. Other disorders in the digestive tract are infectious diseases like Helicobacter pylori infection. Even though symptomatic treatments have been increasing for the treatment of intestinal disorders, the ways of improving and preventing these diseases are still controversial.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n\n      \n      The progress of medicine and treatment is rapid. However, recent approaches to the prevention and improvement of these intestinal disorders are suppressing dysbiosis and preventing chronic inflammation. This mini-review discusses the hypothesis of whether the improvement of the diet is a preferable choice for the prevention of these intestinal disorders. Dietary interventions are beneficial for the prevention and improvement of intestinal disorders since the first approach to intestinal disorders is dietary intervention. The Mediterranean diet, the diet from the 5-a-day campaign, and the Japanese diet are well-known healthy dietary strategies. A healthy diet regimen is not only beneficial for the prevention of intestinal disorders but also a useful strategy to reduce stress and ameliorate mental illness. In addition, the intake of phytochemicals is good for keeping healthy gut microbiota and preventing intestinal disorders. Furthermore, vitamin D3 intake with these phytochemicals works as an adjuvant to improve gut microbiota and upregulate immune responses. As a result, the decreasing production of TNF-\u03b1 ameliorates chronic inflammation and intestinal disorders at an early stage.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      In recent years, prevention of the non-disease condition \"ME-BYO\" has been a popular approach for healthy and long living in Japan. This idea prevents the manifestation of diseases before the onset and is also applicable to intestinal disorders. This mini-review discusses ways of preventing and ameliorating intestinal disorders."

        "abstract": "Despite advanced clinical treatment, the mortality rate of cancer patients is high. Recent studies have linked the development of cancer to inflammation. Many cancers are exacerbated by the emergence of inflammatory responses, and non-coding RNAs play an important role in inflammation. Non-coding RNAs include microRNAs, circular RNAs, long-chain noncoding RNAs, etc. The non-coding RNA regulatory network composed of microRNAs, circular RNAs and long-chain non-coding RNAs is involved in the regulatory process of multiple gene expression. They can act on various signaling pathways, such as wnt/\u03b2-catenin, nuclear factorkappa B, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and so on. These signaling pathways can control the occurrence of inflammatory response to some extent, such as regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-6, interferongamma, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and so on), making them upregulated or down-regulated. Therefore, it is important to study the role of non-coding RNAs in inflammation to contribute to the future of cancer."

Members of the S100 protein family (S100s) have been widely implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of tumors. However, the exact mechanism by which S100s contribute to tumor immunity remains unclear. \nMethods:\n To explore the role of S100s in HCC immune cells, we collected and comparatively analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of HCC and hepatitis B virus-associated HCC. By mapping cell classification and searching for S100s binding targets and downstream targets. \nResults:\n S100A6/S100A11 was differentially expressed in tumor T cells and involved in the nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB pathway. Further investigation of the TCGA dataset revealed that patients with low S100A6/S100A11 expression had a better prognosis. Temporal cell trajectory analysis showed that the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is at a critical stage and has an important impact on the tumor microenvironment. \nConclusion:\n Our study revealed that S100A6/S100A11 could be involved in regulating the differentiation and cellular activity of T-cell subpopulations in HCC, and its low expression was positively correlated with prognosis. It may provide a new direction for immunotherapy of HCC and a theoretical basis for future clinical applications."

In Montenegro, as in Europe, numerous campaigns have been initiated to raise public awareness about the importance of melanoma prevention and its early detection. Thus, accompanying current diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, new methods of melanoma diagnosis and treatment have been implemented. Studying the trend enables the identification of the groups most burdened by mortality and assesses whether there has been a change in trends based on interventions aiming to reduce mortality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the mortality trend from cutaneous melanoma in Montenegro for the period 1990-2018.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n\n      \n      We have utilized national data on the causes of death from melanoma, code 179 from the ninth and C43 from the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, categorized by gender and age groups. The study utilized various regression techniques, including Joinpoint regression in the Joinpoint Program, Poisson regression, and linear regression in the SPSS 26th Program, to describe the trend.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      In Montenegro, during the period from 1990 to 2018, a total of 281 individuals died (51.6% male and 48.4% female). This ranks as the 13th leading cancer in terms of mortality among all cancers. The average age-standardized rate was 1.1 deaths per 100,000 (1.2 for males and 1.0 for females). The number of death cases has been increasing on average by 3.3% annually [average annual percentage change (AAPC) (95% CI) = 3.3 (1.7-4.9); p<0.001] on an overall level and by 5.4% annually among males [AAPC (95% CI) = 5.4 (3.6-7.3); p<0.001] due to the rises in the age groups 55-64 years and 65-74 years with an average annual percent change of respectively 3.2% [AAPC (95% CI) = 3.2 (0.8-5.8); p=0.012] and 5.4% [AAPC (95% CI) = 5.4 (2.7-8.1); p<0.001] overall level, and 4.8% [AAPC (95% CI) = 4.8 (2.4-7.3); p<0.001] and 7.5% [AAPC (95% CI) = 7.5 (4.9-10.2); p<0.001] among males. For females, an increase of 1.1% was recorded, which was not statistically significant [AAPC (95% CI) = 1.1 (-0.8-3.0); p=0.255]. Furthermore, there was a noted increase in the rates at an overall level [\u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.027 (0.008-0.046); p=0.007] and in the age group 65-74 years [\u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.249 (0.090-0.407); p=0.003], as well as among males at an overall level [\u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.052 (0.025-0.079); p<0.001] and for age groups 45-54 years [\u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.102 (0.011-0.193); p=0.030] and 65-74 [\u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.410 (0.144-0.676); p=0.004]. In contrast, the rates for females remained constant. The three age groups most burdened by melanoma skin cancer mortality are 65-74 years (23.5%), 55-64 years (21.7%) and 75-84 years (19.2%).\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      The results of regression analyses indicate a significant rise in both the number of death cases and mortality rates overall, specifically among males in Montenegro. In females, however, the increase in the number of death cases and rates is not statistically significant.

Various premedication approaches have been implemented to preserve renal function, including magnesium (Mg) preloading. However, the optimal Mg dosage is still unknown. Our study aimed to assess the protective effects of different Mg doses as premedication in cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy for patients with local/locally advanced cervical and head-neck cancers.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n\n      \n      This retrospective, multicenter study involved premedication with saline infusion containing potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for all patients before cisplatin treatment. Patients were divided into two groups: 12 mEq MgSO4 (low-dose Mg preload group, low-Mg) and 24 mEq MgSO4 (high-dose Mg preload group, high-Mg). Renal function was evaluated using serum creatinine (sCr, mg/dl) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

Based on the expression of CD34 in the bone marrow, patients were divided into a CD34 positive group (positive cells \u226510%) and a CD34 negative group (positive cells <10%). The study compared the positive rates of common leukemia cell antigens, clinical characteristics, initial treatment responses, and long-term follow-up outcomes between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      Among all 105 B-ALL cases, 87 children (82.9%) had bone marrow CD34 positive cells \u226510%, classified into the CD34 positive group, while the remaining 18 children (17.1%) had bone marrow CD34 positive cells <10%, classified into the CD34 negative group. The CD34 positive group exhibited significantly higher positive rates of CD13 expression, standard-risk B-ALL, and risk stratification than the CD34 negative group. In contrast, the proportions of early pre-B-ALL, E2A-PBX1 fusion gene, and MLL-AF4 fusion gene were significantly lower in the CD34 negative group, with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the positive rates of leukemia cell antigens such as CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD13, CD33, and CD38 between the two groups (p>0.05). The occurrence rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) and relapse after induction chemotherapy in the CD34 positive group were significantly lower than those in the CD34 negative group (p<0.05). However, the sensitivity to the first prednisone treatment and bone marrow treatment efficacy on the 19th and 33rd days after chemotherapy showed no significant differences between the groups (p>0.05).\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      A higher positive rate of bone marrow CD34 expression in children with B-ALL is associated with a favorable prognosis. Children with negative CD34 expression are relatively more prone to MRD and tumor relapse after chemotherapy."

        "abstract": "Protein synthesis regulation is critical for skeletal muscle hypertrophy; yet, other established cellular processes are necessary for growth-related cellular remodeling. Autophagy has a well-acknowledged role in muscle quality control, but evidence for its role in myofiber hypertrophy remains equivocal. Both mTORC1 and BMP-Smad1/5 signaling are reported regulators of myofiber hypertrophy; however, gaps remain in our understanding of how this regulation is integrated with the growth processes and autophagy regulation. Therefore, we investigated the mTORC1 and Smad1/5 regulation of protein synthesis and autophagy flux during serum-stimulated myotube growth. Chronic serum stimulation experiments were performed on day-5 differentiated C2C12 myotubes incubated in differentiation media (2%HS) or growth media (5%FBS) for 48 hours. Rapamycin or LDN193189 were dosed for 48 hours to inhibit mTORC1 and BMP-Smad1/5 signaling, respectively. Acute serum stimulation was examined in day-7 differentiated myotubes. Protein synthesis was measured by puromycin incorporation. Bafilomycin A1 and immunoblotting for LC3B were used to assess autophagy flux. Chronic serum stimulation increased myotube diameter 22%, total protein 21%, total RNA 100%, Smad1/5 phosphorylation 404%, and suppressed autophagy flux. Rapamycin, but not LDN193189, blocked serum-induced myotube hypertrophy and the increase in total RNA. Acute serum stimulation increased protein synthesis 111%, Smad1/5 phosphorylation 559%, rpS6 phosphorylation 117%, and suppressed autophagy flux. Rapamycin increased autophagy flux during acute serum stimulation. These results provide evidence for mTORC1, but not BMP-Smad1/5 signaling, being required for serum-induced myotube hypertrophy and autophagy flux by measuring LC3BII/I expression. Further investigation is warranted to examine the role of autophagy flux in myotube hypertrophy."

        "abstract": "Painful stimuli elicit first-line reflexive defensive reactions and, in many cases, also evoke second-line recuperative behaviors, the latter of which reflects the sensing of tissue damage and the alleviation of suffering. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), composed of external- (elPBN), dorsal- (dlPBN), and central/superior-subnuclei (jointly referred to as slPBN), receives sensory inputs from spinal projection neurons and plays important roles in processing affective information from external threats and body integrity disruption. However, the organizational rules of lPBN neurons that provoke diverse behaviors in response to different painful stimuli from cutaneous and deep tissues remain unclear. In this study, we used region-specific neuronal depletion or silencing approaches combined with a battery of behavioral assays to show that slPBN neurons expressing substance P receptor ( \nNK1R\n) (lPBN \nNK1R\n) are crucial for driving pain-associated self-care behaviors evoked by sustained noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli applied to skin or bone/muscle, while elPBN neurons are dispensable for driving such reactions. Notably, lPBN \nNK1R\n neurons are specifically required for forming sustained somatic pain-induced negative teaching signals and aversive memory but are not necessary for fear-learning or escape behaviors elicited by external threats. Lastly, both lPBN \nNK1R\n and elPBN neurons contribute to chemical irritant-induced nocifensive reactions. Our results reveal the functional organization of parabrachial substrates that drive distinct behavioral outcomes in response to sustained pain versus external danger under physiological conditions."

Among them, adult diffuse gliomas are the most common type, affecting the cerebral hemispheres and displaying a diffuse infiltrative pattern of growth in the surrounding neuropil that accounts for about 80% of all primary intracranial tumors. The hallmark feature of gliomas is blood vessel proliferation, which plays an important role in tumor growth, tumor biological behavior, and disease outcome. High-grade gliomas exhibit increased vascularity, the worst prognosis, and lower survival rates. Several angiogenic receptors and factors are upregulated in glioblastomas and stimulate angiogenesis signaling pathways by means of activating oncogenes and/or down-regulating tumor-suppressor genes. Existing literature has emphasized that different microvascular patterns (MVPs) are displayed in different subtypes of adult diffuse gliomas.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n\n      \n      We examined the distribution and biological characteristics of different MVPs in 50 patients with adult diffuse gliomas.

The median follow-up was 59 (9-102) months. The 5-year overall survival and cumulative relapse incidence were 97.9% and 5.9%, respectively. In terms of different cytoreductive therapies, 86 patients were administered with hydroxycarbamide (30.5%), 113 with anthracyclines or cytarabine (40.1%), 31 with etoposide (11.0%) and 52 with no cytoreductive therapy (18.4%) during the induction therapy. The hydroxycarbamide treatment group did not decrease the relapse rate compared to the no cytoreduction group (11.4% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.289). Compared with the hydroxycarbamide group, the anthracyclines/cytarabine treatment group showed improved 5-year RFS (88.145% vs. 98.113%, p = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that myeloblasts in bone marrow at diagnosis, and PML-RARA transcript level of 6.5% or more after induction therapy were associated with a subsequent risk of relapse. The only factor positively reducing the relapse rate was anthracyclines/cytarabine cytoreductive treatment. In conclusion, cytoreductive chemotherapy in induction therapy plays a potential key role in the prognosis of low-risk APL."

However, it is still unclear how malignant insulinomas develop and metastasize. Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a member of the pentraxin protein family, is an acute-phase protein secreted by liver cells. The role of SAP in insulinoma and the related mechanism are still unknown. To determine the effect of SAP on insulinoma, we crossed Rip1-Tag2 mice, which spontaneously develop insulinoma, and SAP knockout (KO) mice to generate Rip1-Tag2;SAP\n-/-\n mice. We found that SAP deletion significantly promoted the growth, invasion and metastasis of malignant insulinoma through C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Further study showed that SAP deletion promoted CXCL12 secretion by CAFs through the CXCR4/p38/ERK signalling pathway. These findings reveal a novel role and mechanism of SAP in malignant insulinoma and provide direct evidence that SAP may be a therapeutic agent for this disease."

        "abstract": "The liver receives blood from both the hepatic artery and portal vein. Hepatic infarction is rare in clinical practice as both the hepatic artery and portal vein can supply blood to the liver. Here, we reported a case of a 75-year-old man who underwent radical laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer and subsequently developed hepatic infarction. The patient experienced severe infection, as well as circulatory and respiratory failure on the third day after surgery. The patient presented with high fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, decreased blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure. The leukocyte count decreased from 8.10 \u00d7 10^9/L to 1.75 \u00d7 10^9/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels increased from 1.02 ng/mL to 67.14 ng/mL, and eventually reaching levels over 200 ng/mL. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of hepatic infarction, but no thrombosis was observed in the hepatic artery or portal vein. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) identified hypervirulent \nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n (hvKp) in the patient's blood and ascites, one day earlier than the detection results using traditional culture methods. The patient was diagnosed with hepatic infarction combined with septic shock caused by hvKp. This case emphasizes that in the high-risk group of thrombosis, infection can trigger exacerbated hepatic infarction events, particularly in cases after surgical procedures. For severely ill patients with infectious diseases who are admitted to the ICU with worsening symptoms, it is important to collect appropriate samples and send them for pathogen detection using mNGS in a timely manner. This may aid in early intervention and improve clinical outcomes.",

Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been used as a photosensitizer (PS) for PDT, although its poor stability and low tumor-target specificity strongly limit its efficacy. To overcome these limitations, ICG can be formulated as a tumor-targeting nanoparticle (NP).\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n\n      \n      We nanoformulated ICG into recombinant heavy-ferritin nanocages (HFn-ICG). HFn has a specific interaction with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is overexpressed in most tumors, thus increasing HFn tumor tropism. First, we tested the properties of HFn-ICG as a PS upon irradiation with a continuous-wave diode laser. Then, we evaluated PDT efficacy in two breast cancer (BC) cell lines with different TfR1 expression levels. Finally, we measured the levels of intracellular endogenous heavy ferritin (H-Fn) after PDT treatment. In fact, it is known that cells undergoing ROS-induced autophagy, as in PDT, tend to increase their ferritin levels as a defence mechanism. By measuring intracellular H-Fn, we verified whether this interplay between internalized HFn and endogenous H-Fn could be used to maximize HFn uptake and PDT efficacy.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      We previously demonstrated that HFn-ICG stabilized ICG molecules and increased their delivery to the target site in vitro and in vivo for fluorescence guided surgery. Here, with the aim of using HFn-ICG for PDT, we showed that HFn-ICG improved treatment efficacy in BC cells, depending on their TfR1 expression. Our data revealed that endogenous H-Fn levels were increased after PDT treatment, suggesting that this defence reaction against oxidative stress could be used to enhance HFn-ICG uptake in cells, increasing treatment efficacy.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      The strong PDT efficacy and peculiar Trojan horse-like mechanism, that we revealed for the first time in literature, confirmed the promising application of HFn-ICG in PDT.",

Ferroptosis, a promising mechanism of killing cancer cells, has become a research hotspot in cancer therapy. Simvastatin (SIM), as a potential new anti-breast cancer drug, has been shown to cause ferroptosis of cancer cells and inhibit breast cancer metastasis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel strategy boosting ferroptotic cascade for synergistic cancer therapy.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n\n      \n      In this paper, iron base form of layered double hydroxide supported simvastatin (LDHs-SIM) was synthesized by hydrothermal co-precipitation method. The characterization of LDHs-SIM were assessed by various analytical techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Biological activity, ferroptosis mechanism and biocompatibility were analyzed through in vivo and in vitro analysis, so as to evaluate its therapeutic effect on breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      The constructed LDHs-SIM nanosystem can not only release SIM through mevalonate (MVA) pathway, inhibit the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 and reduce the synthesis efficiency of GSH, but also promote the accumulation of Fe\n2+\n in cells through the release of Fe\n3+\n, and increase the intracellular ROS content. In addition, LDHs-SIM nanosystem can induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells to a certain extent, and achieve the synergistic effect of apoptosis and ferroptosis.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      In the present study, we demonstrated that nanoparticles of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) loaded with simvastatin were more effective than a free drug at inhibiting breast cancer cell growth, In addition, superior anticancer therapeutic effects were achieved with little systemic toxicity, indicating that LDHs-SIM could serve as a safe and high-performance platform for ferroptosis-apoptosis combined anticancer therapy.",

However, cuproptosis nanomedicine against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is severely limited by cancer stem cells (CSCs), which reside in the hypoxic stroma and adopt glycolysis metabolism accordingly to resist cuproptosis-induced mitochondria damage. Here, we leverage hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) to regulate CSC metabolism by overcoming tumor hypoxia and to augment CSC elimination efficacy of polydopamine and hydroxyethyl starch stabilized copper-diethyldithiocarbamate nanoparticles (CuET@PH NPs). Mechanistically, while HBO and CuET@PH NPs inhibit glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, respectively, the combination of HBO and CuET@PH NPs potently suppresses energy metabolism of CSCs, thereby achieving robust tumor inhibition of PDAC and elongating mice survival importantly. This study reveals novel insights into the effects of cuproptosis nanomedicine on PDAC CSC metabolism and suggests that the combination of HBO with cuproptosis nanomedicine holds significant clinical translation potential for PDAC patients.",

        "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporters represent a superfamily of dynamic membrane-based proteins with diverse yet common functions such as use of ATP hydrolysis to efflux substrates across cellular membranes. Three major transporters-P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1 or ABCC1), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2) are notoriously involved in therapy resistance in cancer patients. Despite exhaustive individual characterizations of each of these transporters, there is a lack of understanding in terms of the functional role of mutations in substrate binding and efflux, leading to drug resistance. We analyzed clinical variations reported in endometrial cancers for these transporters. For ABCB1, the majority of key mutations were present in the membrane-facing region, followed by the drug transport channel and ATP-binding regions. Similarly, for ABCG2, the majority of key mutations were located in the membrane-facing region, followed by the ATP-binding region and drug transport channel, thus highlighting the importance of membrane-mediated drug recruitment and efflux in ABCB1 and ABCG2. On the other hand, for ABCC1, the majority of key mutations were present in the inactive nucleotide-binding domain, followed by the drug transport channel and membrane-facing regions, highlighting the importance of the inactive nucleotide-binding domain in facilitating indirect drug efflux in ABCC1. The identified key mutations in endometrial cancer and mapped common mutations present across different types of cancers in ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 will facilitate the design and discovery of inhibitors targeting unexplored structural regions of these transporters and re-engineering of these transporters to tackle chemoresistance.",

        "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n\n      \n      As a novel drug formulation, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are widely used in various types of cancer. However, clinically, there is a lack of attention to the CVD produced by them, as well as a lack of research on the real-world situation. Using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, to ensure its clinical safety application, we analyzed post-marketing data on antitumor ADCs to identify risk factors and drugs associated with the risk of cardiovascular events.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Research design and methods:\n        \n\n      \n      We used OpenVigil 2.1 to conduct a database query for adverse events (AEs) reported to the FAERS database between the time the drug was launched and the second quarter of 2023. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were grouped into fourteen narrow categories using the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs), and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) for reporting the association between different drugs and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk were calculated.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      In the FAERS database, 1863 AEs associated with CVD we studied were identified in patients receiving ADC therapy. Most reports came from people aged \u226565, but a significant number of cases were found to be unknown. The number of patients with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-related CVD cases aged <18 years, 18-64 years, and\u2265 65 years was 52 (2.79%), 586 (31.45%), and 613 (32.90%), respectively. The proportion of female patients (834, 44.77%) was higher than that of male patients (752, 40.37%). Death (770 reports), disability (9 reports), Hospitalization initial or prolonged (407 reports), and life-threatening reactions (187 reports). Of the 770 deaths reported, 103 (31.7%) were associated with brentuximab vedotin, 10 (24.4%) with sacituzumab govitecan, 22 (19.3%) with enfortumab vedotin, and 35 (34.7%) with trastuzumab emtansine.49 (41.2%) cases were associated with polatuzumab vedotin, 62 (29%) with trastuzumab deruxtecan, 423 (54.3%) with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and 66 (38.8%) with inotuzumab ozogamicin. In a disproportionate number of SMQS, cardiac failure (\nn\n = 277) and embolic and thrombotic events, venous (\nn\n = 446) were the most frequently reported CVD-related AEs in ADCs.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      By mining the FAERS database, we provided relevant information on the association between ADC use and cardiovascular-associated AEs. ADCs were associated with increased cardiovascular toxicity, deserving distinct monitoring and appropriate management. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess causality.",

We aimed to identify whether miRNA-200 (miR-200), a widely recognized suppressor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, prevents CAFs from promoting cancer progression. Overexpression of miR-200 prevented CAFs from promoting lung cancer cell migration, invasion, tumorigenicity, and metastasis. Additionally, miR-200 suppressed the ability of CAFs to recruit and polarize macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, as well as the migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells. NRP2, a co-receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), was confirmed to be a target of miR-200, which mediates the functional activity of miR-200 in CAFs. NRP2-VEGFR signaling facilitates the secretion of VEGF-D and pleiotrophin from CAFs, leading to the activation of cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings suggest that miR-200 remodels CAFs to impede cancer progression and metastasis and that miR-200 and NRP2 are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung cancer.",

Recent studies have used Cas9 nuclease with paired guide RNAs (gRNAs) to generate targeted chromosomal rearrangements, focusing on producing fusion proteins that cause cancer, whereas research on precision genome editing for rectifying SVs is limited. In this study, we identified a novel complex genomic rearrangement (CGR), specifically an \nEYA1\n inversion with a deletion, implicated in branchio-oto-renal/branchio-oto syndrome. To address this, two CRISPR-based approaches were tested. First, we used Cas9 nuclease and paired gRNAs tailored to the patient's genome. The dual CRISPR-Cas9 system induced efficient correction of paracentric inversion in patient-derived fibroblast, and effectively restored the expression of \nEYA1\n mRNA and protein, along with its transcriptional activity required to regulate the target gene expression. Additionally, we used CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), which leads to the upregulation of \nEYA1\n mRNA expression in patient-derived fibroblasts. Moreover, CRISPRa significantly improved EYA1 protein expression and transcriptional activity essential for target gene expression. This suggests that CRISPRa-based gene therapies could offer substantial translational potential for approximately 70% of disease-causing \nEYA1\n variants responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our findings demonstrate the potential of CRISPR-guided genome editing for correcting SVs, including those with \nEYA1\n CGR linked to haploinsufficiency.",

In total, 64 canine mammary tumors were selected to study the most common markers, which are applicable for human breast cancer treatment, including estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), human epidermal growth factor (HER2/neu), Ki67, and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the protein expression. The Veterinary Nottingham Prognostic Index (Vet-NPI) was also computed. Moreover, univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). The results demonstrated that Ki67 was strongly expressed in the triple-negative tumors, and Ki67 protein expression continuously increased over the increase of Cox2 protein expression (\np\n < 0.001). Further analysis revealed a significant difference among canine mammary subtypes and Vet-NPI, in which triple-negative tumors displayed the highest mean score compared to other subtypes (\np\n < 0.001). In addition, the multivariable analysis revealed that the regional mastectomy procedure (adjusted HR = 2.78 (1.14-6.8)), the triple-negative tumors (adjusted HR = 48.08 (7.74-298.8)), strong Ki67 protein expression group (adjusted HR = 7.88 (2.02-30.68)), and strong Cox2 protein expression group (adjusted HR = 29.35 (5.18-166.4)) demonstrated significantly lower disease-free survival rates compared to other corresponding groups. Overall, canine mammary tumors showed strong similarities to human breast cancer in terms of clinical and molecular aspects; therefore, they could be suggested as a model for human breast cancer in comparative oncology.",

        "abstract": "Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was introduced in 2007 as a first-in-class systemic agent for advanced HCC. After sorafenib, a range of targeted therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated survival benefits in the past 5 years, revolutionizing the treatment landscape of advanced HCC. More recently, evidence of novel combinations of systemic agents with distinct mechanisms has emerged. In particular, combination trials on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab have shown encouraging efficacy. Hence, international societies have revamped their guidelines to incorporate new recommendations for these novel systemic agents. Aside from treatment in advanced HCC, the indications for systemic therapy are expanding. For example, the combination of systemic therapeutics with locoregional therapy (trans-arterial chemoembolization or stereotactic body radiation therapy) has demonstrated promising early results in downstaging HCC. Recent trials have also explored the role of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for borderline-resectable HCC or as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk after curative resection. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials, the real-world efficacy of systemic agents in specific patient subgroups (such as patients with advanced cirrhosis, high bleeding risk, renal impairment, or cardiometabolic diseases) remains uncertain. The effect of liver disease etiology on systemic treatment efficacy warrants further research. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiological pathways and accumulation of clinical data, personalized treatment decisions will be possible, and the field of systemic treatment for HCC will continue to evolve.",

        "abstract": "Biomimetic nanoparticles represent a promising avenue for mitigating rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES); however, current challenges include insufficient tumour targeting, suboptimal adhesion, and inadequate localized drug release within tumour regions. These shortcomings contribute to persistent contests, such as recurrence and pulmonary metastasis, even with advanced breast cancer therapies. Stimuli-sensitive drug release can furbish the membrane coated nanoparticles for their efficiency against the stated problems. To enhance the efficacy of biomimetic nanoparticles in addressing these issues, we proposed a versatile, stimuli-responsive drug delivery system by encapsulating doxorubicin (Dox) and perfluorohexane (PFH) within poly (lactic-\nco\n-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, subsequently coated with macrophage-derived cell membranes. Within this framework, PFH serves as the mediator for ultrasonic (US)-irradiation-triggered drug release specifically within tumour microenvironment, while the macrophage-derived cell membrane coating enhances cell adhesion, enables immune evasion, and natural tumour-homing ability. The characterization assays and \nin vitro\n evaluations yielded encouraging results, indicating enhanced targeting and release efficiencies. \nIn vivo\n studies demonstrated marked inhibitory effects on both breast cancer recurrence and pulmonary metastasis. The resulting data indicate that these engineered nanoparticles have notable potential for targeted delivery and controlled release upon US irradiation, thereby offering significant therapeutic efficacy against primary breast cancer, pulmonary metastasis, and recurrent malignancies.

        "abstract": "Background:\n        \n\n      \n      Approximately 50% of patients harbor the T790M mutation after developing first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) resistance. Evidence has showed the major treatment failure is local relapses and limited metastases. Several studies have demonstrated the value of radiotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the EGFR T790M mutation after the development of TKI resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the role of radiation in T790M-mutant NSCLC and the value of early radiotherapy for NSCLC with T790M-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n\n      \n      Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines were established via stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of gefitinib (PC-9-GR). Droplet digital PCR was used to determine the relative T790M subclone abundance. \nIn vitro\n and \nin vivo\n models were established using different mixtures of PC-9-GR and PC-9 cells. Differentially expressed genes were identified using RNA sequencing. Two research models were constructed (salvage and prophylactic radiotherapy) to determine the effects of early radiotherapy on gefitinib-resistant cells.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      PC-9-GR cells exhibited higher radiosensitivity than PC-9 cells (sensitivity enhancement ratio = 1.5). Salvage radiation reduced the number of T790M-mutant subclones, and the relative T790M abundance was significantly lower than that without radiation at 90 days (10.94% vs. 21.54%). Prophylactic radiation prevented the development of T790M subclones. These results were also confirmed \nin vivo\n. qRT-PCR revealed threefold elevation of miR-1243 in PC-9-GR cells, and the increased radiosensitivity of PC-9-GR cells was inhibited when miR-1243 was knocked down. RNA sequencing revealed that SPOCK1 was downregulated in PC-9-GR cells. Interestingly, bioinformatic analysis showed that SPOCK1 was a target gene of miR-1243. SPOCK1 knockdown markedly increased the radiosensitivity of PC-9 cells.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC with the T790M mutation had higher radiosensitivity than that without the mutation, possibly mediated by SPOCK1. Early radiotherapy can eliminate T790M subclones, providing evidence for the benefit of early local treatment in patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.",

The experimental group received individualized pharmaceutical care based on the \"Yao Nin You Wo\" WeChat Mini Program, while the control group received conventional care during the 4-week period. Main outcomes contained pain scores, medication adherence, incidences and relief rates of breakthrough pain, and incidences of adverse events. Relief rates of pain were also calculated according to pain scores.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      At the beginning of intervention, none of the pain scores and medication adherence showed relevant differences between the two groups (all \nP\n > .05). After intervention, the experimental group had significantly lower pain scores compared to the control group (\nP\n = .003). Breakthrough pain of both groups was alleviate; not only the incidence of breakthrough pain considerably was lower at 4 weeks than at baseline, but the relief rate of breakthrough in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group. Compared with the control group, the medication adherence rate of the experimental group was significantly improved (\nP\n = .02). Types of adverse events that happened in experimental and groups were similar, but the total incidence of adverse events in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n\n      \n      WeChat Mini Program is a useful and facilitative tool with the potential to improve cancer pain self-management ability in discharged patients. In addition, pharmacists could play a key role through the Mini Program to connect with patients successfully by providing personalized pharmaceutical services.",

Sixty fecal samples from PDR, DM, and HC groups were assayed by untargeted metabolomics. Fecal metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Associations between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Results:\n        \n\n      \n      A cluster of 2 microbiome and 12 metabolites accompanied with the severity of DR, and the close correlation of the disease progression with PDR-related microbiome and metabolites were found. To be specific, the structure of gut microbiota differed in four groups. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were significantly lower in PDR and NPDR groups, than those in DM and HC groups. A cluster of microbiome enriched in PDR group, including \nPseudomonas\n, \nRuminococcaceae-UCG-002\n, \nRuminococcaceae-UCG-005\n, \nChristensenellaceae-R-7\n, was observed. Functional analysis showed that the glucose and nicotinate degradations were significantly higher in PDR group than those in HC group. Arginine, serine, ornithine, and arachidonic acid were significantly enriched in PDR group, while proline was enriched in HC group. Functional analysis illustrated that arginine biosynthesis, lysine degradation, histidine catabolism, central carbon catabolism in cancer, D-arginine and D-ornithine catabolism were elevated in PDR group. Correlation analysis revealed that \nRuminococcaceae-UCG-002\n and \nChristensenellaceae-R-7\n were positively associated with L-arginine, ornithine levels in fecal samples.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n\n      \n      This study elaborates the different microbiota structure in the gut from four groups. The relative abundance of \nRuminococcaceae-UCG-002\n and \nParabacteroides\n are associated with the severity of DR. Amino acid and fatty acid catabolism is especially disordered in PDR group. This may help provide a novel diagnostic parameter for DR, especially PDR.",
