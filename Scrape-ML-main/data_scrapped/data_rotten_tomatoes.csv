" Cabrini is surprisingly beautiful, making great use of dramatic lighting and including carefully composed scenes modeled on contemporary photographs by Jacob Riis of How the Other Half Lives fame."
The First Omen's Nell Tiger Free is well cast as Margaret. She plays the role well and her acting during her “pregnancy” and birth scenes is excellent.
Few will be able to watch On the Adamant without being deeply moved and inspired by what they see. 
"The directorial choice is to use animation in many instances, just to break up the interviews and archival footage... which is amusing enough. But what it all amounts to is a story of arrogance, strategic misrepresentation, and/or a massive scam. "
"Although it rarely captures the innovative and imaginative spirit of its visionary subject, this documentary pays affectionate tribute to the artistry and legacy of the late Muppets creator. "
"The Fall Guy’s star power and well staged action scenes make it a solid recommendation. Ironically, a greater emphasis on a tighter script instead of bigger and badder stunts would have made for one of 2024’s top films."
"As a piece of action cinema, Civil War is nearly flawless. But as a story, it falls short."
"Tashi’s beautiful, but the boys aren’t attracted to HER. What they want is to be near her greatness, to have it, to be great; they don’t want to be in her, they want to BE HER.... No, the real source of sexual chemistry is between the boys."
The Last Stop in Yuma County reminds us how gripping neo-noir thrillers can be when properly crafted.
Late Night with the Devil has everything in its favor to turn into an instant cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]
"An all-action over-the-top blast from start to finish, be it the acting or action, Mad Max: Fury Road offers the briefest of quiet moments in between. Yet, it knows how to be both tender and epic. The finale is thrilling…"
"Sure, we know miscommunications and heartache will ensue; it’s a romcom, after all. But it’s a fairly smart, well-acted one that finds its true villain in social media and its divisive, tear-everything-down energy. The movie is a not-so-guilty pleasure. "
"This is an astounding collection of hot people, standing around being hot for two hours."
"A devilishly fun time from Paul Feig, thanks in large part to Blake Lively's sinister performance."
"Dune is a story that combines science fiction, religion, ecology, amazing production value, and a dozen well-known actors. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Dan Stevens, one of the most exciting actors working today, is having a ball playing the role of sleazy Frank."
"The Iron Claw is a wrestling movie, a biopic, a cautionary tale that falls short of being truly haunting."
"A great finale to the journey of Caesar, setting up what’s been a pretty flawless series of movies..."
"Bilott is a scrappy plugger, a Midwestern man with a strong sense of right and wrong who simply cannot walk away from a case that puts every aspect of his own life at risk."
"For a generation brought up on RPGs, this will feel like familiar territory, but for those looking for a little more finesse, this is a very loud and brash film that lacks the subtlety of a finer crafted work."
"Ferrari is a mixed bag, a smarter than average biopic with great acting that still feels incomplete."
"Watching The Blue Angels in your living room, you can’t help but be envious of those making the effort to catch the documentary in IMAX."
It’s not NOT like John Wick but with bees.
"Newcomer Andrew Lobel's script offers nothing more than dramatic ""shock"" effects and forgettable dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]"
Leigh Whannell’s utopian-future horror is daft but entirely in on the joke.
Zany Coen brothers-like comedy thriller.
The film works when it is focused on the creepy crawlies – the smaller the creepier – but loses its way down the stretch into an unfocused bout with social commentary about the power structure being worse than giant murderous spiders.
"Poor Things is a very funny film, with acute social satire and an anti-romantic comedy premise rendered in gonzo, Gilliam-esque fashion. It’s also deeply cynical, though it justifies its own cynicism in its commitment to the bit."
The ordinary business of motivation is of far less importance than the general atmosphere of cartoony retribution and doom. It’s a potent slice of goth fantasy anarchy.
Jeffrey Wright skewers racial stereotypes in Cord Jefferson's brilliant comedy.
"Amid the dumper-truck of post-Covid lockdown-inspired films, very few take disease and pandemics themselves as their central focus. So John Rosman’s stripped-back but effective debut is a sobering flashback to those incubative early days."
"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" maintains a credible tone of seriousness over farce while operating as evocative post-apocalyptic science fiction."
"Despite Jack Black’s relentless enthusiasm and the impressive artistry on offer, Kung Fu Panda 4 unfortunately feels like an underwhelming and unnecessary instalment in a franchise which should have stopped following the heartfelt third outing."
"Unfortunately, The Holdovers really lives up to its name. ... Worth seeing for its playful homage to a very specific slice of cinema history, for its three lead performances, and for a few very good scenes that come before those last, long 30 minutes."
"Nicolas Cage delivers one of his best films, a study on fame, networks, and dreams. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Then again, plot logic isn’t much on writer/director Kiah Roache-Turner’s mind as he pulls inspiration from all the usual sources without really shaking things up enough to transcend the clichés of the genre."
"Anatomy of a Fall is not truly a story about marriage, good, bad, whatever. It is a story about how cinema can reconcile these estranged genres of prose. More prosaically, it is about how a mother needs her son, and how a son needs his mother..."
"Yes, it’s very by-the-numbers, but it’s still interesting to see how a band can build and rebuild its identity. "
"Villeneuve’s “Dune” is the cinematic equivalent of a meditation garden: gorgeous to watch with its characters’ polished skin, smooth stonelike spaceships, sand enveloped landscapes, sunlight "
Never have I walked out so pleased with a movie that also had me absolutely disgusted. A true horror gem.
"Ballad sanitizes its brutality for a PG-13 rating and diminishes the story’s sense of high-stakes survive-or-die suspense, and Francis Lawrence’s approach to action sequences is bland and uninspired, a reflection of the film’s generic visual aesthetic. "
"The cast are on their A game, with what could be my favorite performance from Shia LaBeouf and Dakota Johnson. But the reason to see this film is for Zach Gottsagen’s lead performance."
"The concept of In-Yun promises that after 8,000 years of connecting, they can marry and be together. Nora and Hae Sun are one life closer. "
RackaRacka has crafted a horror film for the ages that will be remembered in ten years as one of the most important in the realm of independent horror.
"The bizarre, fantasy-esque finale will divide opinion but leads into a nonchalant devious act that gives the movie the indelible image it deserves, in keeping with Glass’ grimy, sweaty, surprising flick which proves she can crack all sorts of cinema."
"The dialogue, acting, and story pacing evoke the kind of irreverent, playful attitude that invites enjoyment. Even if, once the cloud of smoke dissipates, we find there's nothing behind it. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The question Glazer’s remarkable film raises in the viewer is, “What atrocities do our comfortable lives allow us to ignore?”"
"A poignant film about parents and partners, Andrew Haigh’s All of us Strangers is the most accomplished work of his career so far."
Oppenhiemer is a return to form for Nolan after the fiasco of Tenet. There's a great movie hiding amidst all of the formal pyrotechnics. But I guess it's too much to ask for a lighter touch from a director who is about as subtle as an atomic bomb.
"Knox is one of his most challenging roles, as it requires him to play a character struggling with shifting mental capabilities, and Keaton – who apparently works well with himself as director – is up to the task. He’s outstanding."
"His House is a Netflix horror film that goes beyond supernatural scares, exploring themes of grief, guilt, and the struggle to belong."
"Miyazaki’s characters feel tangible and human, his action scenes ripe with energy, and his film’s design, as always, abundantly imaginative. "
"As a prequel, it has some slasher moments that are amplified by Goth's sinister performance as the scream queen in the red dress, but unfortunately it frequents too many common places. [Full review in Spanish]"
"One Life comes across like a well-crafted, but modest TV movie, which you might remember for its story, rather than how the story is told."
"Killers of the Flower Moon is, for such a dramatic and dark film, wildly entertaining throughout its epic runtime."
"This is the worst dressed, most haggard cinematic assassin in recent memory, with the ugliest beach villa."
"Those who enjoy a good underdog story with a message, or are committed fans of the increasingly shaggy charms of down-to-earth “everyman” Wahlberg, will find their King in solid, if unspectacular form and territory."
"Disturbia does not shy away from occasional teen angst, and the influence of Rear Window is unmistakable."
"It may play as a standard stalker film in the beginning, it slowly evolves into something else. It’s sad, disturbing, and a fairly unpredictable film. The ending is abrupt, but it allows the viewer to make their own conclusion — which I quite liked."
"The horror lies not so much in the destination, but the journey, and I was shocked by how wrong The Clovehitch Killer was willing to make that journey seem and feel"
"Wonka serves just enough of its own brand of singing, dancing, chocolate-coated sweetness to effectively tell its story of a mildly eccentric candymaker with mommy issues taking on the corrupt bureaucracy of a city that runs on a candy economy."
"{The movie} is a good reason to watch and appreciate the lead performers, Colman and Buckley, who bring different types of intensity to the disparate roles — Colman’s Edith as the repressed do-gooder, and Buckley as the unfiltered survivor. "
"Turtles All the Way Down, the new movie based on John Green’s best-selling book by the same name, is a raw and honest look at how hard being a teenager while trying to deal with mental health issues can be. "
"We’re in the “try anything once” phase of Russell Crowe’s career, and he’s wearing it well."
" May December is wickedly funny on the subject of delusion and the lies we tell ourselves to get what we want, but always there is Joe, the painful reminder of the human cost of those lies and delusions."
"Humbling and epic in scope, designed and conceptualised brilliantly, but a tad too stand-off-ish emotionally. While the father-daughter dynamic works in parts, the Cooper–Brand relationship is never given the right treatment and collapses."
"A shrewd and edgy social commentary, this is an intelligent and contemplative film played out through pithy dialogue and arresting visuals. This is Japanese filmmaking at its absolute best. "
The usual stark realities we’ve been familiar with for how we see the ‘nati give way to the thrilling fun of Cincinnati as a dark and twisted hellscape out of The Twilight Zone.
"This is the debut feature of Bell and Allen, and if it’s any indication of what’s to come, their names should become household knowledge for horror fans."
"In addition to aspects such as effects, the film is especially interesting from a narrative point of view, as it shows how people ignore problems or make them even worse with their actions. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This film can’t quite commit to its interdimensional-war gimmick; it’s an appendage, mostly played for laughs, to the real story, which I kept waiting to arrive -- and when it did, I wished it hadn’t."
In the Land of Saints and Sinners offers a dynamic setting and is energised by performances from emerging and veteran talent.
Toni Collette gives an all-time performance in this family melodrama that endlessly rewards repeat viewings. Aster has delivered one of the best contemporary horror films with only his first feature.
"I think they set it in this very specific world of art, which, even if it's not entirely accurate, it's specific. So within its own world, it feels developed."
The Marvels has its moments but can’t overcome the same old problems we’ve watched plague the MCU for years.
"""The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil"" is not a great film, but it's watchable because its star is Ma Dong-seok. The burly actor stars as a mob boss whose street credibility takes a beating when he is nearly killed by a floppy-haired serial killer."
Plaza projects her character’s apprehension and channels it into moral outrage directed at her attackers as well as her physical and societal limitations. 
"The film doesn’t really say anything new about the rich, or the social climbers who imitate them, but it’s plenty entertaining even as it veers into borderline camp territory in the final twenty minutes. "
[Lawrence and Feldman] are so good and authentic in their feelings and epiphanies that you can almost believe the filmmakers were making a character study rather than exploiting one for cheap laughs. 
"While “Perfect Days” isn’t driven by its plot, but that doesn’t mean there’s a down stretch or a wasted move. It’s a movie about the importance of little moments — and a movie that’s full of such little moments, every one of which is a reward."
Parasite is the movie we will look back on as the movie of 2019. It crosses over to every culture because it’s simply about human beings struggling to survive in an unfair system.
"Anderson’s whimsical, storybook approach fits perfectly for this playful adaptation of a 1977 Roald Dahl short story about how a gambler learns to cheat by seeing through cards. "
"Inside Out reminded everyone that, after a few missteps in the early 2010s, the studio was still capable of instant classics."
"There's a raid on the family home by Kord's private army that's easily the most emotionally devastating scene in any 21st century DC movie (you heard me, Martha), and would stand toe-to-toe with many of Marvel's as well."
Barbarian is a flick that shines with potential and still manages to stand as a worthy watch for any fan of the horror genre.
Ohh right this is what movies used to be like.
"The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole ""Bad Boys one last time"" tagline…"
"The film’s dense, fast-moving cold open harkens back to the franchise’s roots as a Cold War-era spy series."
"The movie, adapted from Pierre Boulle’s 1963 novel by Michael Wilson and Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, effectively explored class divides and slavery, all wrapped up in an intriguing high-concept mix of sci-fi and fantasy."
"Beneath all the laughs at the expense of men and women is the sad truth that this brand of essentialism itself, of separating Barbies from Kens, of emphasizing their differences, is the thing that damages us the most."
"This multiverse mash-up featuring some iconic villains and an MCU Spider-Man in the making, ensures that Tom Holland cements his place at Marvel. With an emotional sucker-punch and pathos to spare Spider-Man: No Way Home really delivers. "
"I eventually got on board with it, and [Jennifer Lopez] is so sweet and sincere... Once you get that this is a vanity film where she pours her heart out, then you can get into the groove."
"It says something about the film industry when just having an original story is enough to get people in seats, let alone with the resumé of Gareth Edwards and Chris Weitz to back it up."
There were so many moments I loved
"The chassis of Baby Driver is the familiar “one more job” predicament smashed and splashed with jolts and sprays of meet-cute romance, catchy music, brass balls, and sheer action. "
"The stories that the Djinn tells are lovely, but the movie really lands in the second half when things get slightly more normal."
Get Out achieves something that few films of its ilk do: build a scary story with human pathologies instead of ghosts and monsters... [Full review in Spanish]
"Tim Blake Nelson shines in Old Henry, a riveting, slow-burning western that pays homage to the great classics from the past while also reviving the genre."
Superhero films suffer significantly from the law of diminishing returns as sequels strain to be better than their predecessors. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse stands out as the antithesis of this notion...
... A movie that entertains and also invites us to reflect on the influence of financial power and the ability of ordinary individuals to challenge the status quo. [Full review in Spanish]
"A sleek, meta, & complex return to this franchise makes for an ALMOST Perfect sequel even if it’s second half could of been stronger"
"Much has already been said about Jane Campion's western masterpiece, and for good reason. It is indeed truly great. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a career best performance."
"Screenwriter Mike White conjures up a series of episodes ... There is much for older, childless adults to enjoy ... splendid animation. ... often quite unexpectedly funny. ... The high quality of the voice cast ensures that every nuance rings true. "
"It starts with an original vision of the hero, has an inspired cast, creates a self-sufficient story and elevates it with a stylized direction that's in line with the film's substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
A hairdresser looking for salvation and a gruff father with a sick daughter make for positive messages and positive people
"The series may never reach this fever pitch again, but we’re glad we got to watch the plan come together in such a memorable way.

"
"That rousing speech by Stanfield is the most powerful moment in The Book of Clarence, but the movie doesn’t hold to that declaration – it lands on a wildly different note, and I’m not sure if that’s a bold move... or one that simply prompts confusion."
"Seems like a miracle that something like this could be pulled off, fully amplifying and improving upon everything each solo MCU movie accomplished before it, while also standing on its own with the team dynamics."
You could fully skip this movie or watch it…it doesn’t matter. Go watch The Last of Shelia
"All this time later, it might have been interesting if Scoop humanised its villain but it is remorseless with Andrew."
"Seven Samurai” remains a timeless masterpiece. Kurosawa's editing prowess, evident in the climactic sequence, cemented the film's status as a timeless classic, echoing the eternal struggle for justice and sacrifice in feudal Japan"
"Even though the humans are the sour mark on the overall film, Godzilla vs. Kong is still enjoyable..."
"“Fresh” is a stylish, uncompromising, and surprisingly artistic depiction of endemic exploitation, the ubiquity of toxic masculinity, and perseverance. "
"The supporting players work together in ways that show Peele’s prowess, not only as a visual filmmaker, but as one who casts well and trusts his actors. Nope is a wild ride, and one I can’t wait to take again."
Knives Out is playful and entertaining but his commentary on political and personal detractions within his life spring forward...
"Arrival is a work that resents the necessity of violence. However, the film ditches some of the meditative qualities of the bleakness-to-idealism dialectic of the album in favor of making a cold hard stand against war and those who clamour for it. "
The vast potential of silence does the trick in A Quiet Place — one of the most terrifying films in recent times for its execution of a unique brand of horror.
Eli Roth gives the holiday the bloody horror comedy it deserves.
"Minari is incredibly tender, and woefully honest."
"Waititi's long-in-development adaptation of the Crump's classic has a style and wit all of its own. Neill is delightfully grumpy, but it is Dennison who steals the show. The over the top buffoonery of the final chase is a bit much, though"
...a stirring action picture that grows more and more absorbing as it unfolds...
"A fascinating, entertaining and – somewhat ironic – look back at a one-time, must-have item that once made up 45% of the cellphone market."
Imagine if Hustle & Flow were written by Philip K. Dick.
"Christopher Nolan's 'Tenet' futzes with the time-space continuum in a top-secret spy tale intended to tank an incipient WWIII, but it's a tad tedious."
"This is a well-crafted, tight 90 minutes that will keep viewers hooked and shows great potential from the up-and-coming filmmakers."
"If the original film’s warmth beneath the cold metropolitan’s structure came from Deckard’s love for Rachel, 2049 extends this ethos to a love and understanding of the self in the greater context of others."
"Lado Kvataniya’s feature debut is a gritty, twisty serial killer thriller, allegorising true crime in a mimesis of murder"
"The acting is spectacular, capturing the stresses of parenting compounded by unimaginable actions and the relationships are uneasy and strained, but executed in engrossing ways to craft the appropriate amount of oppressive dread."
"Rise of the Planet of the Apes has everything a modern summer-movie blockbuster should be, blending smarts with spectacles."
"At times more horror than action, the Mad Max movie that started it all is quite sinister. The editing style, the sound effects, the background score, and the shot composition are all testament to that."
"L.A. Confidential‘s representation of a long-gone era in Los Angeles is exemplary, and the 1950s are enlivened on screen in an accurate and opulent manner."
"The worldbuilding is possibly its biggest accomplishment, as you can start to see the elements of the wasteland take shape."
Its meticulous directorial vision and thematic ambition are what make it a modern masterwork. Once you see It Follows it will follow you forever.
"The wholly absorbing, irresistible character study of two men who aren’t always who they seem to be, one haunted by the demons of his past choices and the other crippled by guilt and attempting to preserve his identity while hiding in plain sight."
"Inside Man is an electric, pulpy crime thriller that only Lee could make, and Washington just gets to operate in such a thrilling space as he tries to save the day amid quite a tense situation."
"Much like in The Babadook, first-time director Babak Anvari allows the question of the supernatural to orbit the action of Under the Shadow."
"…a delicate, rather melancholy film, one that relates to a time when communication is everywhere, but the users of the technology feel more alone than ever…"
"Isolating and bare, Let the Right One In combines appropriate uses of setting and story to tell an affecting drama rich in pathos."
"It is the perfect start to get us into the plot of 'Golden Kamuy', fall deeply in love with its protagonists, and fully immerse ourselves into this frenetic treasure hunt. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Bottoms is the best high school comedy since Booksmart, and, for my money, an instant classic."
