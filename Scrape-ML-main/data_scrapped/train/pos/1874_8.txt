["Off the Italian coast, Luca Paguro is befriended by fellow sea creature Alberto Scorfano who leads him to live on land. Luca runs away from his home in the sea. While on dry land, the sea creatures look human but they turn back when they get wet. They enter a small town where they are befriended by local girl Giulia Marcovaldo. The trio join up for a race competition. The boys dream of buying a Vespa with the winnings and riding away.This is a beautiful looking Disney Pixar movie. The story is simple and sweet. I do have to say that I missed the closeted gay subtext. I looked at it more in terms of passing. Quite frankly, I wanted more dangerous initial stakes. Luca is more in danger on land. It's perfectly safe for him to go home. There is a way to raise the stakes by taking away a safe return as an emergency exit. If the two boys are refugees and their ocean home destroyed, it would raise the danger and their ultimate stakes. If they have to leave the ocean, it would be a more compelling dangerous journey. There are some powerful scenes. The two boys have a complicated relationship. I love Giulia. All in all, this is wonderful Pixar and a sweet little story."]
