['A totally amazing film by Director Quentin Tarantino was "Inglourious Basterds."A group of Nazi soldiers plans to avenge the deaths of Jews throughout Europe by staging a one group hit team to kill as many Nazis as possible.They are soon drawn into a further plot-the killing of top Nazi officials including Hitler himself at a Nazi premier movie glorifying a German soldier who had killed so many.As the German Commander, Christoph Waltz was superb. His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.']
