['I never saw the original, I\'m not a Denzel Washington fan (even though his face is all over my pajamas). But this movie was incredibly awesome.The intensity of Denzel was undeniable as he went on his killing spree. I never expected the movie to get half as violent or gory as it did - this is the kind of thing I expect to see in "se7en" or "Saw"... wow! And complementing this perfectly was a soundtrack heavy with Nine Inch Nails remixes.Now, I dislike Dakota Fanning with a passion. She\'s over-used in movies, she\'s not cute. She needs to find a new dentist because her teeth look rotten out. And when she becomes a teenager, her career is over because she can only play cute little blonde, white girls.I did like the use of "Mickey" in Spanish while the one guy was getting his just desserts. Very appropriate.I strongly look forward to the sequel and the prequel ("Man Standing Precariously Close to an Open Flame"). This film is highly recommended as the best action film of 2004 and one of the best of its genre in a long time.']
