["Some Fun can be had Watching this Messy Movie if One Doesn't Try and Figure Out WTF is Going On in its Daft Definition of Social-Media and Politics.It Name-Drops Buzz-Words and Memes to Grab its Audience.Trying to Point Out the Absurdity that is Our Current Paradigm of Divisiveness that Controls Behavior, Attitudes, and New-Speak in Today's Ludicrous Landscape.Getting a Handle on Most of What Goes On Behind the Blood-Drenched Ballyhoo Presented in this Pretentious Picture is a Challenge.Suffice to Say, Forget the Intellectual Debate.Because the Wit is in Short-Supply and the Script is Sophomoric at Best.The Ideas are Dumbed-Down for the Lowest Common Denominator with Extreme Stereotypical Characters.Everyone Acts Smarter than They are and Everyone Exhibits Loathsome Behavior.Misses the Mark its Shooting for by a Mile.Except in its Exhibition and Exploitation of Gore-Movie Red-Stuff.That's the Aforementioned Fun that this Movie Offers and for that it's...Worth a Watch."]
