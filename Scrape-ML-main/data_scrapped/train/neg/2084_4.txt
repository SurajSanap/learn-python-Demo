['This film very closely follows the plot of the original "classic". An all American family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere (New Mexico desert here) and are attacked by a family ravaged by nuclear radiation.I\'m no fan of the first one. I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it\'s really happening can get to you. It didn\'t scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It\'s surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It\'s not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one. Otherwise--stay away. I give it a 5.']
