["Lara Croft is the daughter of Richard Croft, a famous adventurer who disappeared several years ago. Now she finds clues to what her father was searching for when he disappeared and is determined to follow his path. She heads to East Asia, where adventure and danger await.Formulaic and dull. I wasn't a fan of the original Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, but this is worse. Pretty much your standard action-adventure movie, complete with basic plot, supernatural elements, a search for a lost kingdom and all sorts of perils. It's Indiana Jones / Raiders of the Lost Ark, dumbed down massively."]
