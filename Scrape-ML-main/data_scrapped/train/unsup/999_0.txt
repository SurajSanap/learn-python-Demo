["I just binged both seasons and if they don't make another season I'd be absolutely fine with that.The cinematography is excellent and the performances are consistently brilliant.The plot is weaker than a dead wife's fragile torso.It tries to be sociopolitical instead of just telling a story.It breaks off into so many unnecessary tangents that I found myself not caring what happened to most of the characters.Just give me a Mad Sweeney and Dead Wife road story and bin everything else unless you plan to use Crispin Glover properly."]
