["Roger Moore as James Bond is targeted by the world's greatest assassin Scaramanga(Christopher Lee). All the expected new gadgets are there; some real decent car chases; awesome locales and the obligatory eye catching women like Maud Adams and Britt Ekland. This 007 episode works hard, but still leaves an empty feeling. Lee's talents are wasted. Moore is growing into the role of the super spy Bond. In support are Richard Loo, Herve Villechaize and Clifton James. Be careful where you point that thing."]
