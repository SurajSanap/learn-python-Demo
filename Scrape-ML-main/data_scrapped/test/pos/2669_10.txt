['Aside from a couple of dull stretches, involving of all people, a surprisingly insipid Britt Ekland, this is both an exciting and amusing effort incorporating some great action sequences and a suspenseful, edge-of-the-seat climax which even tops the movie\'s exciting opening with Marc Lawrence. Admittedly, Bernard Lee\'s "M" is getting a bit too perfunctory, but the other characters are well played (although Richard Loo\'s voice is a bit odd – maybe it was dubbed). Christopher Lee has a really great time as the villain, and let\'s not forget the super-lovely Maud Adams. Fortunately, there\'s not so great an emphasis in this installment on crazy inventions and effects. Indeed, the approach to these standard Bond items is welcomely tongue-in-cheek. Instead, the movie concentrates on the exotic locations in Macau, Honk Kong and Siam, all of which are used as exciting backgrounds for some marvelous chases and action material. Admittedly, the scenes involving the American tourist are a bit heavy-handed but Ossie Morris\' sharp deep-focus location photography overcomes much – even the dull work of Ted Moore who obviously photographed the more routine studio interiors. Sets of course are a major asset, as usual, and the music score has plenty of zing. Production values are first-class. Admittedly, Hamilton\'s direction is no more than competent, but he knows when to give Morris and the location directors their heads – and that\'s the name of the game!']
