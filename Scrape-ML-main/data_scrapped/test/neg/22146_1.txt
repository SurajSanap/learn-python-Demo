["This series moves slower than usual. Each episode seems to follow people around as they pick up shoes, articles of clothing, food etc in a slow and deliberate manner. The dialog seems stilted (I used the subtitles option) but that made no difference. Common to many Swedish productions, this one has a lot of non-verbal moments where the actors just stare into space, and the camera hones in on their eyes, mouth, or other part of the anatomy. There is just too much padding to drag the series out when the story could have been done in just 4 episodes. The only different thing about this series was that the usual 10 Swedish actors who appear in most of the Swedish productions were not recycled in this one.Common to most of the Swedish productions the plot includes some holes, and illogical as they may be, it's an effort to ensure a satisfactory ending where everyone is happy with the outcome, and no one is offended."]
