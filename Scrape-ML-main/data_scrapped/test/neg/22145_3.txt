['In this Viking "noir" we have a contrived situation where leaver-student Maya is a mistaken accomplice of a classroom mass shooting, tension wrought solely by Maya being in the wrong place, at wrong time, with wrong people. What sort of civilized judiciary of would allow a bells-and-whistles trial of a teen on such flimsy evidence? A State Prosecution proceeding on so many counts - conspiracy, plus all THREE counts of murder? ABSURD. Counsels for defense and prosecution would have surely struck some sort of lesser-charge deal here. Unsuitably researched to say the least. A ridiculous situation.']
