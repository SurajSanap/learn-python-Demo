["Even if you don't mind the obvious socio-political agenda of the storyline, this series is low on compelling story and high on fluff. 95% of the first episode is run-of-the-mill back story that could have been summed up in a few minutes or borrowed from a hundred other teenage love stories.The story is told as flashbacks, intercut with present day, and honestly the whole 6 episodes could have been 2 or 3 episodes with all the useless fluff removed."]
