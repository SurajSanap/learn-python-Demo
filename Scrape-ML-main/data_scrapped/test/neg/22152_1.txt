['Because of my age, I guess, I had no idea what the outcome of the court\'s decision would be. I hadn\'t even heard of Ivan the Terrible.This incredibly well-made documentary was heart-wrenching. The facts stated by survivors will keep me up at night and brought me to tears more than once.Their honest recollections of the cruelty inflicted upon so, so many men, women and children were beyond comprehension. But, did they have the right man in front of them?Their rage was justified; but was it the actual Ivan they were accusing?Yes, of course, I\'d be sure one moment, then convinced quite otherwise the next.Watch it. All of the way through. You HAVE to.The participants of this trial then and presented again now in this documentary was sheer brilliance. I can\'t say that I "enjoyed" this film, but I am very glad to have seen it. Clearly, I needed the education.']
