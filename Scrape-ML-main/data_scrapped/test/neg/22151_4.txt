I can say how I feel, yeah ok he was "that" monster, but does it make it true, sadly probably not.\nWhat about those who were convinced that claimed and fought hard for his innocence, does it make it true? no\nI think it\'s a great series also that voluntarily or not, has created a deep and fragmented dilema about the meaning of justice, and opened a debate on free will.']
