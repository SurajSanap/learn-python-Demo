['There are two kinds of zombie films, great and crap. As zombie fans know, the crap exponentially outnumber the good. Fortunately, Dead Set is far above crap & is one of the most original, interesting & gruesome movies made! Now, I hate reality TV & know nothing about Big Brother other than the Orwell novel. DS set in the BB house, has a great cast and the idea of them knowing nothing as the zombie holocoaust begins is frakking brilliant. No spoilers here other than saying the acting is superb and the sfx awesome. I only wish our British cousins would have shared it a bit sooner! This was so good, it takes the taste of Survival of the Dead & Diaries of the Dead out of my mouth!']
